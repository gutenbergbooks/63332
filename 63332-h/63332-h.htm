<span class="cheaderfont">MANUFACTURING PUBLIC OPINION</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When war broke out I was picking late cherries
in our garden near the Rhine. A boy came by
with the news on a flysheet. I ran and bought a
paper and then told our gardener’s wife. Her
face went pinched and white, for she was the
mother of many sons; but she only pulled her
shawl a little tighter round her shoulders, and
then, with the immemorial stoicism of the peasant,
turned to her work again. She remembered the
days of “seventy,” when, as she often used to tell
us, the regimental bands had to play their loudest
in order to drown the sobs of the women as the
troops marched to the station.</p>

<p>No such memories haunted the bulk of the
German people. The whole of Bonn was delirious
with joy at the declaration of war. They were
absolutely certain of victory, and already treated
foreigners, and especially Englishmen, with withering
contempt. They seemed to be glad to throw
off the mask they had been wearing for years. The<span id="Page_2" class="pagenum">[2]</span>
Great Day had arrived when Germany was to
reach a pinnacle of glory unattained by any other
nation in history. She was to become the arbitress
of the destinies of the whole human race. This,
at any rate, was the feeling that chiefly struck
foreign observers. But I do not think we shall
ever do justice to the Germans until we realize
that for most of them the war came as a surprise.
To the very last they thought the crisis would
pass over as so many others had done. I can
best illustrate the prevailing mood by what happened
to myself. The day before Germany was
declared in a state of war, I bade good-bye to
my students for the term, and said I hoped no
war would prevent us from meeting again in
October as usual. I was answered by a loud
burst of laughter. Yet even while I was speaking
a detachment of troops was marching past the
University in order to take up a <a id="Ref_2">position
guarding</a> the bridge across the Rhine. The
intoxication of the Germans at the opening of
hostilities was the natural reaction from the long
years of strain and preparation for war, and it was
the more violent because it was so unexpected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DOCTRINE OF WAR</div>

<p>It is difficult for Englishmen to understand
how all those years the Germans lived in the
shadow of war. Every student of German affairs
knows that the Government controlled the organs
of public opinion and with what fine cunning and
persistence it infected the national mind with its<span id="Page_3" class="pagenum">[3]</span>
doctrine of war. I am concerned here only to
give a few instances of how the poison worked.
When I came back to Bonn from my first summer
vacation in 1905, my chief asked me what people
in England were saying about the war. “What
war?” I answered. “Why,” he said, “the war
between England and Germany.” So accustomed
had they become to the idea of this war, that long
before it broke out, they spoke of it as something
present and real. Extremely instructive were the
antics of the German Government after the publication
of the interview with the Kaiser in the
<cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> in 1908. It will be remembered
that the German people were furious because in
this interview the Kaiser denied that the German
Fleet was to be used against England, alleging it
was for use against Japan. The nation felt it had
been tricked, because it would not have spent so
much money to provide against a war with Japan.
To allay the excitement, the Government sent
round an article to the little provincial papers,
intimating that the Kaiser’s interview was a well-intentioned
effort to befool the English. Then it
went on to say in so many words: our fleet is not
intended to be used against Japan, it is intended
to be used if England should ever introduce Protection
and Colonial Preference. Our fleet must
be so strong that England would never dare to
embark on such a policy. This article did not, of
course, appear in the leading journals, because<span id="Page_4" class="pagenum">[4]</span>
then it would have attracted too much attention
in England. As it is, it appears to have gone
unnoticed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCE OSKAR</div>

<p>But this affair of the interview had another
and more interesting sequel. One of the Kaiser’s
sons, Prince Oskar, was at the time a student at
Bonn. Every November the Rector of the University
gave a great inauguration dinner, and the
guest of highest rank present had to propose the
toast of the Kaiser. Usually the Princes request
some one else to do it for them, because most of
them are incapable of making even the simplest
speech. But, to the surprise of everybody, this
year Prince Oskar rose to speak, and the wonder
grew when it became obvious that the speech had
been written for him by his father. In veiled
language, the meaning of which, however, was
clear, the interview was thrown over, and we were
told to prepare for war. Now, Prince Oskar had
been my pupil, and the fact that I should be
present at the dinner had not escaped the attention
of whoever prepared the speech. So after he had
sat down, Prince Oskar tore off a corner of his
menu card and sent me a note to the effect that
he wished to drink my health. We accordingly
raised glasses and drank to one another across the
crowded hall. I still have the “scrap of paper”
in my possession&mdash;a lasting testimony to the
tortuous diplomacy of the Hohenzollerns.</p>

<p>This is, perhaps, the best place to state what<span id="Page_5" class="pagenum">[5]</span>
I learned of the character of Prince Oskar and his
associates. He had been very strictly brought up,
in seclusion, somewhere in the country. So well
had he been looked after that till he was twenty-one
he had never been in Berlin alone. He had
all the traditional piety of the Prussian Junker, the
piety that made Bismarck, in applying for the
hand of his future wife, write a long letter stating
his religious beliefs in full. I can best illustrate
his character by repeating his argument in favour
of the existence of ghosts. “What I say is, with
God everything is possible. If He wanted to
make ghosts, He could. What is the difficulty,
then? Of course there are such things as
ghosts!” The ingenuous youth failed to see that
by the same reasoning one could prove the existence
of griffins, dragons, the unicorn, winged
horses, sea-serpents, and Mrs. Harris. He was
generally considered by the professors at Bonn
the most intelligent Hohenzollern that had visited
the University. His conversation was about
country life and sport, and, above all, the army.
He was a soldier through and through, and the
army was his life. He often expressed a wish to
die on the battlefield, shot through the heart.
This wish has not been gratified. His health
broke down in the first year of the war, and he
was invalided. Afterwards he was appointed
Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces. He
has distinguished himself in this position by<span id="Page_6" class="pagenum">[6]</span>
starving his soldiers and then telling them to go
to the front if they wanted anything to eat. His
God was “our good old German God,” a Being
as horrible as Moloch and as stupid as Mumbo-Jumbo.
But at any rate Oskar was sincere, and
there are no scandals about him as there are
about the Crown Prince, who, to quote the German
phrase, departed from Bonn like the devil, leaving
a smell behind him.</p>

<p>Prince Oskar may be forgiven for the crudeness
of his religion, because his teachers were even
worse than he. At the end of the Semester he
used to give a dinner to all his tutors. The chief
guest was one Zorn, a Prussian who had been
imported from North Germany to teach the
Princes law, because the Rhinelanders were not
supple enough. Zorn twice represented Germany
at the Hague Conferences, and I believe he is
a recognized authority on International Law.
During the dinner the Prince had occasion to
speak of his sister’s aptitude for mathematics.
“Why,” he said, “she is quite silly; she actually
loves the stuff.” Zorn immediately chimed in.
“My daughter is like that; my daughter is silly
too. She <em>likes</em> mathematics. When I get home
I shall tell her how silly Her Royal Highness
your sister is, and I am sure she will be most
sympathetically touched to hear that Her Royal
Highness is as silly as herself.” Thus are compliments
paid in the Land of Culture. Afterwards<span id="Page_7" class="pagenum">[7]</span>
we went out on to the terrace, and Zorn monopolized
the conversation. He delivered two lectures,
the first a warning against humour. He advised
us never to make jokes in our lectures, humour
and science being incompatible. He added, “I
never joke.” Then he went on to prove the impossibility
of doubting the existence of God. He
railed against mathematicians for being atheists,
although they every day assume the existence of
quantities without proof. Why could they not
assume the existence of God? Needless to say
this champion of Prussian piety was one of the
first to rush into print with a defence of Germany’s
action in Belgium. I have no doubt that, if he is
alive now, he is still writing pamphlets in honour
of frightfulness. When we remember that their
instructors, the very flower of the nation, men
with European reputations for scholarship, are of
such common clay, can we be surprised at what
the Hohenzollerns do?</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAGUE CONFERENCES</div>

<p>Much of the talk that went on that night is
interesting now, especially in the light of what has
happened since. Zorn frankly admitted that the
ill-success of the Hague Conferences was due
to Germany. “Much more might have been
attained,” he said, “if only <em>we</em> had wished.” His
estimates of the English representatives are worth
recording. “Fry was only a good frame to the
picture. For Satow we had the greatest respect.
He was a hard nut to crack. He gave us more<span id="Page_8" class="pagenum">[8]</span>
trouble than all your men put together.” But he
spoke with most admiration of Fisher. It was a
curious thing, because Zorn speaks no English
and Fisher apparently no German, but such was
the open breeziness and cordiality of Fisher’s
manner, that the two became fast friends. Then
the talk wandered to the relations between France
and Germany, and we skated on thin ice, because
both an Englishman and Frenchman were present.
But it was obvious that an attempt was being
planned to draw France over to Germany’s side
by representing to her that an alliance with
England was not worth while, as she would only
be pulling the English chestnuts out of the fire.
Finally, one of the Prince’s aides, Major Graf von
Dohna, gave me his impressions of the Boxer
expedition. “Of course,” he said, “each army
thinks its officers the best. We think ours the
best, as you do yours. But there is one thing
where you are undoubtedly superior to us, and
that is in the relations between the officers and
the men. Your officers get on with their men
much better than ours do.” He deplored the
English attachment to sport, saying that the
Tommies, whenever they had a free moment, got
out a football and began kicking it about. But
the Japs spent every minute of their spare time
watching the German drill, greedy to learn whatever
new details they could.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOROCCO CRISIS</div>

<p>To come back to where I started from. No<span id="Page_9" class="pagenum">[9]</span>
one could deny the strong agitation going on
against England, but not till after the Morocco
crisis of 1911 did I think it meant war. We are
now so much accustomed to the idea of war that
it is hard to realize that there was a time when it
seemed fantastic. Panic-mongering is a favourite
sport of European Governments, and the methods
employed in Germany were not so different from
those of other countries. Moreover, a considerable
body of public opinion was opposed to war.
Those great export houses whose business depended
upon England’s good-will, were especially
eager to maintain friendly relations. The Kaiser
and his family were unpopular in Rhineland,
perhaps because this province has never been
thoroughly Prussianized, perhaps for other reasons.
When the Crown Prince paid a visit to Cologne,
once, no preparations were undertaken to give
him a grand reception, on the ground that as yet
he had done nothing for Germany. Things never
seemed to me to be so bad between England and
Germany as they had been between England and
Russia, and I imagined there would always be
enough common sense in both countries to avoid
the supreme folly of war. It is easy to see now
that I underestimated the power of the court and
rated far too high the influence of public opinion.
I forgot, too, how easy it is to manufacture public
opinion, when occasion demands.</p>

<p>In 1911 I married, got naturalized (after many<span id="Page_10" class="pagenum">[10]</span>
fruitless endeavours to obtain a post in England),
and settled down to spending my life in Germany
with the full inner certainty that the peace would
be kept. And then came the Morocco debates
in the Reichstag, and it was obvious to every one
that war was inevitable.</p>

<p>The Morocco crisis was admirably utilized by
the German Government. It definitely swung
round the great mass of public opinion against
England. Its first fruits were an increase in the
Naval Estimates which otherwise would have
been impossible. The Government took courage
and became far more cynical in its agitation than
before. For instance, one year the International
Yacht Races were held in Germany. Several
English yachts took part and an English peer
gave a cup to be competed for. The Kaiser, of
course, attended and greeted the English with a
speech of welcome, in which the usual platitudes
were said. Immediately the German provincial
papers were flooded with articles pointing out
that the Kaiser was bound as host to say something
nice to Germany’s guests, and that his
words of friendship really meant nothing and
were not to be taken seriously. The Government
understood the fine art of inflaming the
people’s passions and so contrived their news that
everything that happened in England seemed to be
a personal insult to Germany. For example, the
launching of a new battleship would be announced<span id="Page_11" class="pagenum">[11]</span>
in thick type and the ordinary Philistine reading
his newspaper would somehow get the feeling
that here was another sly trick of perfidious
Albion. Everything that tended to the discredit
of England was dragged in and made much of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND INCAPABLE</div>

<p>The vagaries of the Suffragettes and the
dangers of the Irish situation were Heaven-sent
gifts for the Germans. When the Germans were
accused of ravaging Belgium, they answered with
a detailed calculation, proving, to their own satisfaction
at any rate, that they had not destroyed
half so much as the Suffragettes. The political
situation was exploited so as to make the Germans
believe that the English were incapable of any
great effort. They could not even control their
women! How could they face the Germans,
then? Every month the reviews proved that
the British Empire would fall to pieces at the
first touch of war. At the same time the blame
for the enmity between England and Germany was
entirely thrown on England. England wanted all
the German colonies. England wanted German
trade. England wanted a war so as to divert
public attention from the Suffragettes and the
wild Irish. Germany desired nothing so much
as to live in peace, only her wicked neighbours
would not let her. The Lichnowsky Memoirs
had not yet been published, and Dr. Mühlon was
still an official at Krupp’s.</p>

<p>Conversations, that I was able to enjoy from<span id="Page_12" class="pagenum">[12]</span>
time to time with official persons, threw a lurid
light on all this agitation. The building of
strategic railways all converging on the Belgian
frontier was a matter of frequent discussion. I
remember at a wedding-breakfast in 1913 sitting
at the same table with a young lieutenant of
artillery who had just been commanded to a
munition factory near Bonn. He looked pale
and worn-out, and explained that the factory was
working day and night. Germany was two years
ahead of France and Russia in its preparations
and, as soon as it was ready, would go to war.
We asked when that would be. “When the
changes in the Kiel Canal and Cologne railway
station are finished,” he answered. “At present
our new Dreadnoughts cannot pass through the
canal, and we cannot mobilize our troops quickly
enough with Cologne station as it is.” He was
the best of prophets. The rebuilding of the canal
and of the station were both finished in July,
1914, and in that month Germany declared war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SURPRISE OF WAR</div>

<p>But, you will say, how in the face of these
facts can you declare that the war took the
German people by surprise? Well, we all know
that we are going to die, but we should be
surprised to die just now. For the Germans,
the war was a watched pot that had forgotten
to boil. The newspapers were managed with
exquisite cleverness during the crisis preceding the
outbreak of hostilities. The German Government<span id="Page_13" class="pagenum">[13]</span>
was going to proclaim war. Very well, then,
they said, let us represent the matter as if peace
were fairly certain, and as if the only obstacles in
the way are the contumacy of a petty country
like Serbia and the corrupt ambitions of the
Russian Grand Dukes. On the very day war was
declared, the <cite>Cologne Gazette</cite> solemnly assured
the Belgian people that the stories as to German
intentions of invading Belgium were only British
or French inventions. “You want to know how
many soldiers there are in the great camps near
the Belgian frontier? We can assure you there
are none at all. These camps are quite empty.”
The German people believed that a great struggle
for peace was going on, in which, owing to the
fear of the German sword, the peace-makers were
getting the upper hand. They were led to
believe that the German Emperor had so generously
embraced the cause of Peace, that the
balance of chances inclined against War. Peace
was dangled before their eyes like a fair apple,
attainable, but tantalizingly just out of reach.
And then when war did come, the German people
turned with all the fury of disappointment, not
upon their own Government, but upon Russia
for supporting Serbia, and upon France and
England for joining her. They had been taught
ever since they were little boys at school that
the righteous development of Germany was being
thwarted at every turn by England, who had<span id="Page_14" class="pagenum">[14]</span>
managed to hem them in with a ring of foes.
With a deep breath of relief they drew the sword,
confident in their ability to hew down whoever
stood in their way. “Better an end to horror,
than a horror without end,” says the German
proverb, and in this spirit they went to war.
But even Germans can be tricked too often.
I do not think we need take much thought about
how to punish the Kaiser and the other criminals
responsible for this war. We need only hand
them over to their nation, confident that the
people whom they have so long befooled and fed
with lies will know how to deal with them.
Nothing is less likely than that the German
people will forgive those who, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avec un cœur
léger</i>, plunged them into the frightful catastrophe
that befell them. I must apologize for insisting
at such length upon the insincerities and crooked
ways of the German Government, but I do insist,
because at the present time it is necessary to
understand quite clearly the kind of people with
whom we have to deal. And while explaining
how the German people were misled, I am offering
no excuse for the spirit in which they
conducted the war, once it began. The Government
may have ordered the atrocities in the first
place, but the nation has always set the seal of its
approval on the actions of the Government after
the deed, and so the nation has made itself
jointly responsible.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">LIES AND SPIES</span></h2>
</div>


<p>War having finally broken out, the Government,
of course, did not relax its hold on the Press.
The early days brought a fine crop of fantastic
inventions. The utmost was done to heighten
the people’s illusions. The semi-official telegrams
declared that England would remain true to its
time-honoured principle of making money out of
other people’s difficulties and abstain from taking
part. This was at a time when Germany had
already sown mines in English waters, arrested
every English sailor in Germany, and cut the
Jamaica cable. Japan was said to be about to
conclude an alliance with Germany. A Frenchman
was alleged to have poisoned wells in Alsace-Lorraine.
While the Government invented the
absurd story of a French aeroplane having been
seen over Nuremberg before the war broke out,
they quite concealed the fact that in the early
days of the war French aeroplanes really did
visit Coblenz. My authority is a priest who
nearly lost his life from the shrapnel of the
German air defences. The Government did not
even spare its own citizens. A circumstantial
report appeared in all the newspapers to the<span id="Page_16" class="pagenum">[16]</span>
effect that the innkeeper Nicolai, of Cochem, and
his son had been put to death for trying to blow
up a railway tunnel on the Moselle. The affair
created a sensation, because Nicolai was known
far and wide for the excellence of his wines.
The report was allowed to run for some time,
and then the public were told that there had
indeed been some charge of the sort against
Nicolai, but upon investigation it had been withdrawn.
And if you ask why a simple private
citizen should be libelled in this way, the answer
is easy&mdash;it was to heighten the prevailing spy-fever
by suggesting that spies were to be found
everywhere, in the least likely places.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPIES</div>

<p>For from the beginning the Government
began a merciless campaign against foreign spies,
and let it be known that the whole country was
swarming with French and Russian agents in
disguise. The mob was given to understand
that they had practically a free hand in dealing
with any of these agents they should meet. A
frenzied spy-mania sprang up and no Frenchman
or Russian was safe in the streets. In a certain
hospital at Bonn twenty foreigners were being
treated at the same time as a result of the
injuries inflicted by the mob. In Cologne, at a
particular street corner, fifty men were mobbed
in one day. I myself saw one such scene. An
unfortunate Russian had been recognized in the
street, and the police had come up just in time to<span id="Page_17" class="pagenum">[17]</span>
save his life and were trying to get him to the
police-station. The people all the while surged
round from every direction, brandishing their
sticks and uttering that peculiar mob-yell which
is more blood-curdling to listen to than the howl
of a pack of wolves. It is true that by such
methods a certain number of spies were detected;
but a far larger number of innocent persons
suffered, and those mostly Germans. The mob
thought a spy would be likely to try and disguise
himself by putting on some sort of uniform, so
they set upon anybody in official dress whose
looks did not please them. One friend of ours,
who was wearing an old Landsturm uniform,
from which some buttons were missing, was three
times hauled by the mob to the police-station.
Another friend was a nurse, wearing the regulation
cap and veil, and she was taken so often to
the police-station that at last the officer lost all
patience and drove the mob forth with such
curses as only a German can swear. The priest
who told me about the air-raid on Coblenz, in
addition to nearly being killed by stray shrapnel,
was attacked by hooligans, and but for the
timely arrival of the police would have been
robbed of all he possessed. The most amusing
case (from a non-German point of view) was that
of a member of the Reichstag on his way to
the historic session at the Royal Palace on
August 4. He was a little stout man with a<span id="Page_18" class="pagenum">[18]</span>
peaked imperial beard, and he was wearing some
sort of unfamiliar Court uniform that looked more
French than German. The mob set upon him,
threw him to the ground, and by the time the
police intervened had all but kicked him to
death.</p>

<p>I may add two stories of how real spies were
detected&mdash;and this owing to the neglect of the
merest trifle. The bridge over the Rhine at Bonn
is very carefully watched, and every vehicle must
be accompanied across by a soldier. A motor-car
was once being thus conveyed, with two officers
in it, when something unfamiliar about them
attracted the attention of the guard. He looked
at them more closely, and discovered that with
the uniform of the artillery they were wearing the
spiked helmets of the infantry. (Artillery helmets
end in a ball.) He had the car stopped, and it
transpired that the two men were officers in the
French Army on a special mission to the interior
of Germany. They were tried and shot the same
day.</p>

<p>The other instance is of an oversight equally
trivial. A lady was travelling in the train from
Aix-la-Chapelle to Cologne, when her attention
was caught by the label of a London tailor sewn
in another lady’s jacket which was dangling from
the rack. The owner of the jacket was continually
running into the next compartment to
have a talk with a wounded officer, whose arm<span id="Page_19" class="pagenum">[19]</span>
was in a sling. “She was like a nervous rabbit,”
my informant said. When the train pulled up
in Cologne station a detachment of soldiers was
waiting on the platform, and they at once arrested
the wounded officer. He was an English spy, and
his bandages were full of maps and other incriminating
documents. (The names of all persons
in uniform who board a train are registered, and
by the time they reach their destination it is
known whether they are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> travellers or
not. A telegram does the rest.) It was obvious
that the wearer of the English jacket was also a
spy working together with the man who had been
arrested. At first the German lady could not
bring herself to give information which must inevitably
cost the life of a woman. She hesitated
a long time, but in the end duty to the Vaterland
prevailed, and she told the authorities. Meanwhile,
however, the Englishwoman had left the
station and was speeding away in a taxi. But the
soldiers rushed out and sounded a peculiar signal,
at which every vehicle within hearing is bound to
stop and wait further orders. The Englishwoman
had not got far enough away, she was arrested,
and she, no doubt, suffered the extreme penalty.</p>

<p>To return from this digression. The German
Government worked on the feelings of the people,
not only through the spy mania, but in all sorts
of crooked and underhand ways. It was given
out that Rhineland was going to be invaded by<span id="Page_20" class="pagenum">[20]</span>
the French through Belgium, and that in this flat
country the French would have an easy time. For
the first week or two of the war people in Rhineland
were distinctly nervous. Learned professors
used to discuss what would happen if the French
came to Bonn, whether any one would be left
alive, or any building would survive their fury.
It seems ridiculous, when one looks back upon it,
but it all served the purpose of the Government
very well. It directed the rage of the people
against the foreign enemy and away from their
own rulers, and it heightened the “Kriegsstimmung.”
In time the Government could play upon
the people just as they liked. I remember once
that reports appeared in the Dutch papers that
600 men a day were joining Kitchener’s Army in
London, and 2000 a day in the whole of England.
The German newspapers reported that only 600
men from the whole of London had joined, and
from all England only 2000. (This was in
September.) The people were immensely relieved,
they thought that England was already
sorry she had joined in the war, and would only
put up a half-hearted fight. I was spending the
evening with acquaintances when the news arrived,
and a bottle of wine was immediately fetched up
from the cellar to celebrate it. In this connection
I need scarcely refer to the speech of John Burns
that was specially forged, except to say that some
German books still refer to it as that “much-disputed”<span id="Page_21" class="pagenum">[21]</span>
speech, and then proceed to quote
large extracts from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR EDWARD GREY</div>

<p>Especial pains were taken to vilify Sir Edward
Grey. A story appeared in the <cite>Cologne Gazette</cite>
that at a dinner-party in July, 1914, Sir Edward
Grey had been speaking of the troubled political
situation in England, and had finished up, “Only
a war can save us now.” Another story was that
at the critical moment in the negotiations he had
telegraphed to Petrograd the one word “Now.”
Russia had immediately mobilized, and so made
war inevitable. Or another method of attack was
employed. It was put about that Grey was only
a nincompoop, a weak man, the tool of others
cleverer than himself, and the real villain of the
piece was Nicholson. It was my favourite joke
to ask the Germans who this Nicholson was.
Grey was the best-hated man in Germany. The
curses heaped on his head, however, only used
to amuse me, specially as they always pronounced
his name to rhyme with “cry.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIES</div>

<p>Extraordinary care was taken to write up the
navy. Germany’s honour was felt to be especially
concerned here, and defeat was doubly bitter,
because it came from the hands of Britain. I
was in Kiel during the war, and heard a great
deal about the magnificent espionage system of
England. I was informed that the English
Admiralty knew beforehand down to the smallest
unit what ships composed the German Fleet that<span id="Page_22" class="pagenum">[22]</span>
fought at Dogger Bank. Their spies watched
the Kiel Canal and managed to convey the news
to the English Admiralty before the ships were
well out to sea. While at Kiel they had few
illusions as to England’s naval strength, it was
different in the country at large. Reverses were
never admitted, and the German people thought
that their fleet really never had been defeated.
Heligoland Bight, Dogger Bank, and even the
Falkland Islands were thought to be glorious
victories. It is true that no German ships survived
the battle of the Falkland Islands; but a
report appeared in all the German papers saying
that the English had already been completely
beaten in this battle when the Japanese appeared,
and it was they who polished off Von Spee. Losses
were concealed in the most ridiculous way. The
<em>Friedrich Carl</em> sank in full view of the Russians,
and its loss was announced in their official
bulletins. Yet the German Government never
let their own people know of it. This policy of
secrecy was carried too far, and sometimes irritated
the fleet. Once a cruiser was badly injured
in the Baltic, but she managed to make her way
to Kiel, steering backwards, and all the time
dodging submarines and mines. It was a superb
piece of seamanship. The Government never
said a word about it, for the simple reason that
they did not want the public to know how strong
the enemy was in the Baltic. But the men<span id="Page_23" class="pagenum">[23]</span>
concerned were inclined to grumble, because they
felt the public did not honour them as they deserved.
There is a great deal more I could say
on this subject, but what I know I learned under
conditions that make it impossible for me to break
silence. Enough to say that the tactics of the
Government were successful. The confidence of
the nation in the German Fleet&mdash;and also of many
neutrals&mdash;remained unbounded. A favourite saying
among the German soldiers was, “We overrated
many things, but the English Navy most
of all; it has done nothing.”</p>

<p>The successes of the army were written up in
much the same way. For instance, the winter
battle at the Masurian Lakes was so announced
as to appear three battles instead of one. First,
part of the results were announced, then more,
and then finally a complete account was given,
but this was done in such a way that the people
believed that three victories had been gained; and,
as a matter of fact, the houses in Bonn were beflagged
three times. One habit of the Germans
is interesting to note at this particular moment.
Whenever the Russians retreated, systematically
destroying everything as they went, the German
General Staff held up holy hands of horror. The
Kaiser sent a special telegram about the “terrible
but beautiful” sight of the ring of burning villages
round Warsaw. The Germans forgot to say that
these villages consisted for the most part of wooden<span id="Page_24" class="pagenum">[24]</span>
huts, easily rebuilt, and that not much of beauty
or value was destroyed. It is interesting to note,
too, just now, what measures of revenge the
Germans took. Once in retreat the Russians
were unable to bring away their stores of bread,
so, in order to make them unfit for human food,
they drenched them with petroleum. Hindenburg
comes along, and is informed of it. “How
thoughtful of the Russians!” he exclaimed.
“We’ll give it to their prisoners to eat.” Which
was done, with the result that many of them
died. When the day of reckoning comes, and
the criminals are brought before the bar, Hindenburg
must not be forgotten. He is an East
Prussian, and has conducted the war with a
cruelty possible only to one of his race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN PRINCES</div>

<p>The most impudent forgeries in the German
papers are the speeches attributed to the Kaiser.
The utmost has been done to enhance his position
in the eyes of the world and of his own subjects.
When the war broke out, tradition demanded that
he should address the Berlin crowd from the
balcony of his palace. The German papers report
him as having told the crowds to go home
and pray. But the correspondent of the <cite>Nieuwe
Rotterdamsche Courant</cite> wrote that the Kaiser said
nothing of the sort, and that his speech was full
of the most “drastic expressions.” The Kaiser
and his family were presented to the people in a
cloud of lies. When the Germans bombarded<span id="Page_25" class="pagenum">[25]</span>
Scarborough, it was put about that Prince Henry
(the Kaiser’s brother) had been very much against
it, the idea being to insist on the chivalry of his
nature. But he is a Prussian of the Prussians, a
very Hindenburg of the sea. Allied papers have
been inclined lately to jeer at the Kaiser, because
none of his sons have fallen in action. This is a
little unfair. One son at least has been wounded.
Prince Eitel Fritz has gained the admiration of
all his men by his desperate bravery. An N.C.O.,
who has fought under him, told me he seemed to
seek death. Another N.C.O., who had been in
the thick of it at Verdun, told me the Crown
Prince was popular as a soldier, and had the
knack of getting the most out of his men. The
other German Princes have, on the whole, shown
themselves worthy of their great positions, and
have been an inspiration to their men. The
Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe, of the Bonn Hussars,
was renowned as a daring patrol-rider. These
things I know from soldiers themselves, not from
newspapers trying to write up the cause of
absolutism. The Kaiser’s family has not had an
altogether easy time of it during the war. Many
are known to be English in their sympathies, and
it was even said to be fashionable in Court circles
to speak German with an English accent. A
sister of the Kaiser lives at Bonn, and for an
unfortunate remark she made she had to undergo
the rebuke of plebeians. At the beginning of the<span id="Page_26" class="pagenum">[26]</span>
war there was a great rush of Bonn women to be
nurses. They adopted a most unbecoming uniform,
the veil in particular being a monstrous
black thing that reminded you of a funeral mute.
The Princess said they ought to have a prettier
veil, “like those they have in England.” The
reply was priceless. She was informed, “We are
all good Germans here, your Royal Highness.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CENSORSHIP</div>

<p>In one direction the censorship exercised a
healthy influence. When war broke out, the
German hatred of the enemy found the coarsest
and most disgusting expression. For instance,
the <cite>Bonner Zeitung</cite> (a newspaper written by the
professors for the professors of the University),
reporting the shooting of a Russian lady for
espionage, added: “And now the carrion of her
carcase is rotting in its well-deserved grave.” (I
disdain to render the original more exactly.)
Picture-postcards and flysheets were issued in
thousands, in which all the resources of the
filthiest imagination in Europe were employed
to vilify the enemy. But one day they disappeared
like magic from the shop-windows, and
the newspapers took on a cleaner tone. After
the news of the destruction of Louvain came, the
papers were inclined to exult and glorify the deed.
But a sign from the Government was enough to
keep their enthusiasm within bounds. It is the
habit to laugh at the Germans for their slavish
press, but I am certain they would not have held<span id="Page_27" class="pagenum">[27]</span>
out so long as they have done under any other
system. Only in England is it possible for the
populace to be daily fed with wild stories of
the incompetence, stupidity, or treachery of the
Government, and yet to continue to prosecute
the war with undiminished vigour.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE TREATMENT OF THE ENGLISH IN GERMANY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is curious how much sympathy there was for
England even months after the beginning of the
war. Ladies whom we knew had always had
their dresses made in London, and asserted their
intention of doing so again as soon as the war was
over. Others, who were strongly attracted by
the freedom of English life, still felt the charm in
spite of all that had happened. And when they
were in the company of people they could trust,
they used to say how much they were longing for
the war to end in order that they might resume
the pleasant relations which had been broken off.
They never doubted that the English would meet
them halfway. Such of my students as were in
England when war was declared were loud in
praise of the courtesy with which they had
been treated. Communication was possible with
England through Holland, and these students
were still receiving letters breathing assurances
of friendship. The German Government had at
the very beginning laid their hands on the
personal possessions of all Englishmen who had
left Germany. I tried in vain to rescue the
property of my friends who had fled at the<span id="Page_29" class="pagenum">[29]</span>
outbreak of war. The War Office had been there
before me. On the other hand, the officials in
England were not so quick. My students were
getting their effects sent out to them through
Holland without any hindrance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH TRADE</div>

<p>It was curious to notice how things English
had risen in public estimation when once they
were hard to get. Huntley and Palmer’s biscuits,
for instance, ruled the German market in time of
peace. No German biscuit can be compared with
them for a minute. An officer we knew wrote
home asking his mother to send him out some
biscuits. She trudged all over Bonn in search of
Huntley and Palmer’s. At one shop they offered
her German ones, saying they were just as good.
She flared up at once. “Do you think,” she said,
“I would send German biscuits to my son at
the front?” Finally the indomitable old lady
managed to get a tin of English biscuits, and she
sent them off. All the mourning crêpe, arm-bands,
and so on, worn in Germany were imported from
England, even long after war was declared. A
merchant told me that the Germans could not
manufacture it, they simply had to have English
crêpe! Jokes were often cut at the expense of
the business instincts of the English; they got
up a war to kill German soldiers in order to sell
mourning to their mothers and wives. I could
hear of nothing else being imported from England
except English books. All the new publications<span id="Page_30" class="pagenum">[30]</span>
on the English market arrived regularly and could
be inspected at the University Library. Even
the little propaganda booklets of the Clarendon
Press were there. I subscribed to the <cite>Morning
Post</cite> through a Dutch bookseller and for nearly
a year received every number, except the one
describing the attack on Scarborough. That was
suppressed.</p>

<p>Although I had nothing to complain of,
Englishwomen married to Germans were subject
to the bitterest persecution. Coffee parties would
be formed, to which they would be invited, and
then each guest present in turn, by those little
stabs that women know so well how to inflict,
would see how she could torture the “Engländerin.”
A certain “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Professorenfrau</i>” we knew
wanted to try the same tactics on me. She made
the most extravagant efforts to convert me to her
way of thinking. When everything else had failed
she even visited the members of my household and
suggested they should make my life a hell to me
until they had brought me round to the German
point of view. Then she tried to entrap me.
She was putting on the usual pose, asserting that
Germany had never expected that England would
make war on her and that nothing had surprised
her more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A VIRAGO</div>

<p>“Well, then,” I assured her, “how do you
explain the fact that <em>four days before the declaration
of war</em> Germany arrested all the English<span id="Page_31" class="pagenum">[31]</span>
sailors in the country, even those in little sailing
vessels far up the Rhine, as well as other Englishmen
she thought it desirable to keep?” I gave
her the names of acquaintances of mine who were
put in the common jail without being accused
of anything&mdash;and this before the declaration of
war. She refused to believe it, and requested me
to give her a written statement over my signature.
This was the trick always played by German
agents on Belgians in neutral countries. If they
made a written declaration and signed their names
to it, their families in Belgium would suffer for it;
while if they refused&mdash;then they were branded as
liars. I, of course, refused, and the woman broke
out into a storm of abuse. I have never seen a
more horrible figure, even among the drunken
viragos of Whitechapel. At last, fearing for my
eyes, as her fingers were obviously itching to be
at me, I bowed, and left the room as hastily as
was consistent with dignity.</p>

<p>But though I never took any trouble to conceal
my English sympathies&mdash;in fact, they were notorious&mdash;I
had nothing to complain of except from
this woman. It is with especial pleasure that I
record that my relations with my students were
never so cordial as in this last Semester. My
correspondence was censored from early days, and
the essays my students sent me all went through
the Censor’s hands. This caused some hindrance
to the work, but they simply thought it a good<span id="Page_32" class="pagenum">[32]</span>
joke that the Censor should have to read their
essays. (Letters addressed to me were always
censored; letters addressed to my wife never
were. It is a curious example of the limitations
of official intelligence.) My colleagues and other
friends, when they discussed the war with me,
were quite fair, and seemed only interested in
discovering the English point of view. Some of
my acquaintances were good enough to inform me,
with all the exactness and conscientiousness of
German pedantry, what they thought of England,
and then to add they did not want that to interfere
with our relations. If I laughed at their clumsiness,
I valued their good will. The professors of
English throughout Germany were the bitterest.
They did not help their countrymen to understand
England at all. One man told me he was going
to learn to speak English with an American accent
and insist on his students doing the same. Another
spent his time translating a Dutch book, proving
that Germany was superior in material resources
to the whole of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Of course, although private friendships might
remain unaltered, it was dangerous to speak
English in public. Americans had an especially
bad time. An acquaintance of mine had a
tankard of beer emptied over his head for speaking
English in a Bavarian restaurant. The
populace used to invent the absurdest rumours
about the English people living in Bonn. They<span id="Page_33" class="pagenum">[33]</span>
were all spies, they were all going to be arrested,
they were all living in cellars, not daring to show
their faces. The soldiers who were quartered on
us from time to time used to bring a budget of
these tales about me and amuse the servants with
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH TRADE</div>

<p>The Government began their campaign against
English trade at once. The Sunlight Soap Works
passed into German hands in the first days of the
war. What the terms were I never heard, but
as it was a forced sale they could not have been
generous. English insurance companies are
popular in Germany, because they can be relied
on to pay up. Holders of English policies were
informed that they could change over into German
companies, who thus acquired the bulk of the
English business in Germany. The Government
also tried to bring about an international agreement
by which, in future, the lengths of sewing
cotton should be given in metres and not in yards.
They thought in this way to strike at the English
control of the market. Certain companies, like
Singer’s Sewing Machine, were the objects of
bitter and unscrupulous attacks in the press, and
they, no doubt, lost a great many of their
customers.</p>

<p>Englishmen in business were cheated in all
sorts of underhand ways. One man I knew was
taken to Ruhleben and left his wife (a German
woman) in charge of the business. All her<span id="Page_34" class="pagenum">[34]</span>
assistants combined to render her life insupportable,
and finally she had to give up the attempt to
carry on. As a result, foreseen of course, the
business was sold at a heavy loss. Another friend
of mine had an especially tragic experience. For
some years he had been the chemical director of
a German factory, staying on there more out of
friendship to the proprietor than for what he was
making out of it. He was on his holidays in
England all that fateful July before the war broke
out, and on the 31st he received a wire from the
factory, imploring him to return. He did so, and
as soon as he arrived was informed that his salary
had been reduced by one-half. He protested, and
was curtly told he must economize and must cut
down the number of his servants&mdash;one was quite
enough in time of war. Then, in November, he
was interned in Ruhleben. His firm promptly dismissed
him and refused to pay his salary any longer,
although he had the usual contract providing for
six months’ pay in lieu of notice. In December
the German Government let him go back to Bonn
for a few days to see if he could regain his position.
Those Englishmen who were kept on in their old
posts were being released from Ruhleben. His
firm would not take him, they had other ends in
view. He had in his possession a book containing
a number of chemical formulæ. These formed
practically his stock-in-trade and were extremely
valuable. Some were old family secrets handed<span id="Page_35" class="pagenum">[35]</span>
down from father to son, others were the results
of his own independent research. The firm tried
to cajole him out of his formulæ, but, failing in
that, started an action at law against him for the
possession of the book. He knew nothing about
it till one day a representative of the firm appeared
at Ruhleben, and in the same breath informed him
of the action, that he had lost it, and that he must
deliver up the book for some time. He did so.
Whether he ever got it back again I do not know.
In any case his firm was in possession of all his
secrets without paying him a penny for them. It
throws a curious light on “German efficiency”&mdash;and
in chemistry, too!&mdash;that they have to resort
to such measures to steal an Englishman’s knowledge.
I need scarcely comment on the difference
between German and English ideas of justice. In
Germany, the Englishman condemned in his
absence, unheard; in England, every German,
even Krupp, represented by the best counsel
money can buy, and his case carefully and patiently
listened to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INJUSTICE</div>

<p>One other instance of ill-treatment I add. It
is rather important and I have not seen it referred
to in any publication, although some of the victims
must already be in England. It is asserted that
when war broke out there was a sort of agreement
between the English and German Governments
to the effect that male subjects of military
age in either country should be free to return<span id="Page_36" class="pagenum">[36]</span>
home up to August 11. After that date they
would not be allowed to leave the country.
Now, it was easy for Germans to leave England&mdash;the
trains were running, and the Dutch service
of ships was working just as in peace time. In
Germany it was quite different. Twenty-four hours
after the declaration of war the whole of the railways
were taken over by the military authorities
and used solely for the purposes of mobilization.
Englishmen, therefore, who happened to be in
Germany, had to stay just where they were. But
some enterprising Englishmen in Cologne endeavoured
to charter a Dutch steamer in order to
go down the Rhine on her to Rotterdam. After
protracted negotiations they succeeded. But they
had to face so many difficulties that they did not
reach Wesel, the last big place in Germany on the
Rhine, till midnight of August 11. As they had
exceeded their time, they were all taken prisoners
and sent to Sennelager. No preparations had
been made to receive them, there were no huts
or buildings to shelter them, there were not even
any tents. To make matters worse, the rain
came down in a steady downpour for two days.
They themselves were wet through to the skin,
and even their good leather suit-cases were sodden
and the contents ruined by the rain. After a little
while the Englishmen were sent back home again
until it was time for them to go to Ruhleben.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE ARMY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Before I became naturalized I went into the
question of military service with especial care. An
old friend of mine had for many years been at the
head of a Recruiting Department. I went to him
and laid the case before him, and he assured me
categorically that in no event should I ever be
called upon to serve in a war against England.
Other people I consulted confirmed what he had
said, and their testimonies removed the chief
obstacle in my mind to naturalization. When the
war broke out, no one ever dreamed that untrained
men of my age, even Germans, would be called
up. People remembered the days of 1870, which
seemed such a tremendous war, when not even all
the men available were sent to the front. But as
the winter of 1914 deepened and the strain on
Germany’s resources of man-power grew more and
more severe, it became evident that no one of
military age would escape service. At the beginning
of March, 1915, all the able-bodied men of
Germany were called up for medical inspection. I
was examined and declared fit for the infantry.<span id="Page_38" class="pagenum">[38]</span>
So, indeed, was every one else who was sound on
his legs, including one-eyed men. A friend of
mine who could not see across the room without
his glasses was sent into the infantry, his eyes not
even being looked at. Most of the other men were
sent to the artillery, and one very bandy-legged
man to the airship division. There was a general
laugh at this; the man’s legs were curved like a
barrel, and it was certain that to walk the length
of a Zeppelin would be the limit of his powers.
The number of absolute rejections was infinitesimal.
Afterwards, however, a few obtained a respite of
some months. The municipalities seemed to find
it easy to get exemption for their cases. For instance,
one man was released because he was the
janitor to the new municipal Girls’ School. Even
an English tribunal could scarcely have found a
more trivial reason than that. Heads of large and
important businesses managed to get off, but there
was no exemption for the small man, even though
military service meant for him absolute ruin.
Bribery was frequent, and I knew of many cases
where a timely present secured the transference
of a soldier from the much-dreaded infantry to an
artillery regiment. The German non-commissioned
office staff are generally to be bought, except where
an educated man happens to be appointed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALSATIANS</div>

<p>As soon as I was declared fit for the infantry,
I took what steps I could to avoid military service.
I protested to the Oberkommando at Coblenz,<span id="Page_39" class="pagenum">[39]</span>
giving them the full details of my history. The
Rector of the University supported my protest
with a very vigorous letter. As a result I was
ordered to a regiment at Cassel, where Alsatians
were being trained, who were destined like myself
for the Russian front. If the Alsatians we had
are typical of their race, then Germany’s cause is
hopeless in the two provinces. Our Alsatians
could be divided into two classes&mdash;the talkative,
who were few, and the reserved, who were many.
The talkative oozed patriotism, they were bubbling
over with it, and were so obviously insincere
that the Germans thought of them only with contempt.
By far the greater part were taciturn,
gloomy, and hard. No exception could be taken
to anything they did or said, but they were obviously
with us but not of us. They never joined
in singing our songs, except “O Strassburg,” and
that they used to sing with wonderful pathos.
One little Alsatian was the butt of all our N.C.O.s.
He was only half-witted, and had been sent into
the interior of Germany because he was considered
dangerous in Alsace. He was so stupid
that he could never learn the simplest thing, and
he was always going off to sleep wherever he
might happen to be. Our instructors, with the
brutality of the peasant, used to find in him a
source of endless jokes. It was interesting to
watch the other Alsatians while this was going on.
They would go white and tremble with suppressed<span id="Page_40" class="pagenum">[40]</span>
emotion, and their eyes would flash dangerous
fire. Afterwards, when they were sure that they
were alone, they would gather round their unfortunate
countryman and do their best to comfort
him. When the poor man arrived at the front,
he was at once sent back to the garrison as unfit
for service in the field. Soldiers who fought in
France in August, 1914, told me that their reception
in Alsace was quite different from what it was
in Germany. All along the railway line down to
the boundary of Alsace they had been welcomed
by cheering crowds, and gifts had been showered
upon them at every station. But the moment they
entered Alsace, everything was changed. They
were met with cold looks and a dogged, sullen
silence. The Alsatian regiments at the very
beginning of the war were thrown across to the
Russian front. The general testimony was that
they did brilliant service there, and I could only
gather one instance of desertion <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUSITANIA</div>

<p>My military career was rather abnormal, because
at the very beginning I sprained my leg
badly and had to go to hospital for six weeks. It
was an interesting experience, because here I met
soldiers from all fronts and learned a great deal
about the war. We were miserably fed, and but
for supplies from home would have starved. There
was a curious comradeship among us. The working
men used to come and say to me, “It isn’t so
bad for us, this starvation, but it must be awful for<span id="Page_41" class="pagenum">[41]</span>
you. You are not used to it.” While I was there,
the news of the sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em> came.
A scene ensued that I shall never forget. Some
one was reading all about it from a newspaper.
First the bare news, at which there was some excitement,
not much; then an account of the ammunition
destroyed, at which there were cheers; and
then the announcement of the deaths of women
and children. The whole room went mad with
delight; cheers, mingled with roars of laughter as
at a good joke, were loud and long. The very
horror of the massacre increased their satisfaction
at it. A few French prisoners of war were being
treated in the same hospital. We were forbidden
to speak to them, and they always took their walks
when we were indoors. But at some risk I
managed to smuggle in French newspapers to
them, especially one containing the announcement
that Italy had declared war. They were obviously
more cheerful after receiving these papers, and
wanted to express their thanks, but I had to make
them signs not to take any notice of me. The
Germans at that time were said to be mollycoddling
their French prisoners and trying to
make them hate the English. At Freiburg a
French prisoner of war used to give lectures at
the University. He was conducted to his lecture-room
by sentries with fixed bayonets, who waited
outside the door, and then took him back again
at the conclusion of the lecture.</p>

<p><span id="Page_42" class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>I was kept far too long at the hospital. I
enjoyed the opportunity of taking walks in the
beautiful parks of Cassel, and, as I was not seriously
ill, I could go to the theatre as often as I
liked. From time to time the doctor asked me
if my foot still troubled me. To a question so
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naif</i> there could be only one answer. One early
learns to play the old soldier. Finally, however,
he sent me back to the regiment with a recommendation
that I should have an easy time of it
for a week or so. For a whole fortnight I was
employed on “Innendienst,” that is to say, I
worked in the barracks itself. Every morning
we would go up to the lumber-room and fold
blankets. When we had folded all that there
were to be folded, the sergeant would come along,
kick them all to the ground, and we had to do it
over again. It was not malice on his part, but
necessity. He had to find work for us, and that
was all he could do. My companions were working-men,
and they were very much amused because
I wanted to work and objected to doing
nothing all day. They were always quoting a
proverb&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">“Wer Arbeit hat und sich nicht drückt,
</div><div class="indent3">Der ist verrückt.”
</div></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">(“Who has got work and does not shirk,
</div><div class="indent3">He is a fool.”)
</div></div></div></div>

<p>The whole art of life, not only of these working-men
but of all other German working-men I met,<span id="Page_43" class="pagenum">[43]</span>
could be summed up in that proverb. The mere
fact of being idle afforded an exquisite pleasure
to these people. The sergeant in time took pity
on me and dispensed me from the necessity of
coming at all. And so my poor feet, which were
supposed to be too weak for marching, used to
carry me over hill and dale, by forest and meadow,
through all the surroundings of Cassel. By the
time I had finished, I was “some” malingerer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAINING</div>

<p>It would take me too long to detail all the
delightful accidents that befell me. Suffice it to
say that it was not till the middle of July that I
began my full training, and on the 17th August I
was sent to the front. At that time I had never
been on patrol, or dug a trench, or seen a bomb.
I had fired about ten rounds of live ammunition,
and I scarcely knew one end of the bayonet from
another. It is true that when I came out of hospital
I had to go to a bayonet class. I had never
been there before, and of course could not handle
a bayonet properly. The instructor shouted,
“Here, you there, you know nothing about
bayonets, go back to the ranks.” He was only
a country policeman, and it did not seem to strike
him that the less I knew the more he had to teach
me. Once the lieutenant in his tour of inspection
invited me to have a fencing match with him. I
suppose he thought that as an educated man I
would have learnt my drill, and that we should
give the company a high-class exhibition of fencing<span id="Page_44" class="pagenum">[44]</span>
with the bayonet. Instead of which, I went for
him like a wild cat and chased him round the
quad. He came back, panting and tired, but quite
good-natured, and he seemed rather to have enjoyed
the experience.</p>

<p>I had never been taught any of those thousand
and one things which are so necessary in the field.
I could not roll my mantle, the N.C.O. had to do
that for me, when I set out for the front. I had
only once taken a rifle to pieces and cleaned it.
All this means little to the layman, perhaps, but
the soldier will read it with a grim smile. The
fact was all the corporals said, “You’ll not go out
with us, you are too far behind. You must wait
and get trained with the next lot.”</p>

<p>I had tried to get transferred to a stretcher-bearer
corps, but the sergeant-major said I must
first finish my training, and that would take me
three months yet. The same day he reported
me as fit to go to the front. I protested to the
captain that I was quite untrained, and he only
answered, “You have been reported to me as fit
to go to the front, and to the front you must go.”</p>

<p>Much has been written about the severe discipline
of the German Army, but I noticed very
little of it. The feeling which ruled among the
officers was, here are people who are about to
face death and unheard-of privations for the
Fatherland, we must treat them well while they
are still at home. Punishments were rarely<span id="Page_45" class="pagenum">[45]</span>
given, except for gross disobedience. All sorts
of things were winked at, which in times of peace
would have brought us days of arrest. We had
one fiery little lieutenant, who was continually
losing his temper and inflicting on us extra drill,
but we always ignored him, and so did the corporals,
whose business it would have been to
stay behind and superintend the drill. Some of
the sergeants were abominably lazy. They
would march us into the forest, select a likely
place, tell us to lie down, and then wander about
picking wild raspberries, first placing a sentry to
see what the captain was doing. Suddenly a
hoarse stage-whisper would be heard, “Herr
Feldwebel, der Herr Hauptmann kommt!”
(Sergeant, the Captain is coming), and the Feldwebel
would roar in his best “command-voice,”
“Sprung, auf, marsch, marsch,” and we would
disappear into the depths of the forest. Once
when we were idling like this by the side of a
grassy lane, the General Commanding the Corps
rode by. The silence became electric, we expected
a great storm, and our expectations were
heightened when he suddenly stopped his horse
and ordered one of the men to rise and come to
him. But the Great Man only pointed out that
a strap was wrongly buckled, and then rode on.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells has made much in “Mr. Britling”
of the stupid mistakes committed by the officers
training English troops. Ours were no better.<span id="Page_46" class="pagenum">[46]</span>
Nearly all our sham fights went wrong. One
night we had orders to attack a certain party,
but not finding them, marched away home. The
“enemy,” meanwhile, had received no orders of
any sort, so they remained on the “field of
battle” for hours. Finally they took their courage
in both their hands and marched home too.
Such mistakes were always being committed. I
do not say that our officers were especially stupid.
It is only that blunders are inseparable from any
form of human activity. Those made by English
officers, which so much excite Mr. Wells, could
be paralleled in any European country during
the war. In one thing the English War Office
did <em>not</em> blunder&mdash;that is, when they refused the
offer of Mr. Wells’s services as a soldier, until
they had got the younger men trained.</p>

<p>The spirit of the men was excellent. They
were keen to learn what it was necessary to
know; but as our curriculum was so meagre that
it could be mastered in a month, they did not see
why they should bother too much about repeating
things they could do already. One aspect of
military life bored us intolerably. With the idea
of enlivening our existence, games were introduced,
such as blind-man’s buff, hunt-the-slipper,
and similar drawing-room fooleries. The men
got so tired of these that they preferred to go to
the front to do a man’s work. I need hardly say
that such games as football were never heard of.<span id="Page_47" class="pagenum">[47]</span>
We had, of course, all kinds of gymnastics, which
would have been very good if carried out properly.
But here discipline was at its slackest. One of
the exercises, for example, was to climb a steep
boarding fifteen feet high and then drop down
on the other side as best one could. Those who
were afraid were allowed to indulge their luxury
of fear, no constraint being put on them whatever.
A rage of disgust and contempt used to
fill me at times when I saw how perfunctorily we
were trained. The men were still intensely
patriotic and confident of a quick and crushing
victory. Drink and drabbing were looked down
upon as unsoldierly by the majority of the men,
but in this I think we were exceptional. From
all that I could hear of other recruiting depôts,
the war served with the majority of soldiers as
an excuse for throwing restraint to the winds.
The Government was on its guard, and in certain
towns&mdash;for instance, Cologne&mdash;sentries were
posted at the entrances to disreputable streets, and
no soldier was allowed to pass. But in our depôt
the soldiers were nearly all over thirty, and they
were mostly married men. There was among
them an exalted feeling of devotion to the Fatherland
and of comradeship. When the call came
to go to the front, many volunteered who could
successfully have pleaded some physical ailment
as an excuse for staying at home. I am proud
to recall my association with these troops. We<span id="Page_48" class="pagenum">[48]</span>
were a real band of brothers. Rich and poor,
high and low, educated and uneducated, all
mingled together on terms of simple and unaffected
equality. I did not find it so afterwards.
At the front and in captivity social distinctions
played a great part in embittering the relations
between the “kameraden.” It is true that in
order to take your place in this society, you had
to employ rather drastic methods. I remember
once having a quarrel with the two soldiers who
shared my locker with me. They were going off
on a week’s holiday, and insisted on taking the
key with them. It is no good being a gentleman
in cases like this. I simply called them every
bad name I could lay my tongue to, and in the
army you learn some bad names. After I had
finished (which was not soon), they handed me
the key with every appearance of respect, and
whenever afterwards trouble appeared to be
brewing for me, they used to say, “Here, you
leave that man alone: he is our friend.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">BARRACKS</div>

<p>Their patriotism is the more to be wondered
at, because there is no doubt they were made to
endure much hardness. For the first ten days of
our training we all had to live in barracks. I
shall never forget this time; not even the squalor
of a Russian prison has left such an impression
on my mind. There were far more soldiers than
beds, so some of us had to sleep on mattresses
on the floor. At the beginning there were many<span id="Page_49" class="pagenum">[49]</span>
men with infectious diseases. The man who
slept next to me was in an advanced state of
tuberculosis, and he coughed all night. On the
other side of this man was a soldier suffering
from syphilis. We complained about his being
put with us, and the doctor only shrugged his
shoulders and answered that his was not a very
infectious case. However, he was at last taken
to hospital for treatment. We were never certain
of getting the same bedding every night, and we
were supposed to share washhand-basins. My
first serious quarrel came when I insisted on
washing myself under the tap. This was felt as
a reflection on my partners in the washhand-basin.</p>

<p>The food was miserably insufficient for an
active open-air life, and most of the men had to
get supplies from home. Tea and coffee were
dark slops scarcely to be distinguished from one
another. On the other hand, the bread and
sausage supplied were excellent&mdash;the best to be
got in Germany at that time. We used to receive
two loaves of bread a week, and when I took
mine home the servant-girls all along the streets
used to offer to buy them from me. We were
paid about sixpence a day, but out of this we had
to buy blacking, brushes, polishing materials, and
several other odds and ends. We had two meals
a day&mdash;dinner about twelve, and supper, a very
light meal, at seven. Besides, coffee was supplied
first thing in the morning. I am certain that no<span id="Page_50" class="pagenum">[50]</span>
soldier who confined himself to the rations supplied
could have held out for a week. After the
first ten days those who could afford it received
permission to live out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAINING</div>

<p>We used to get up every morning at five or
six o’clock. Then there would be a march to
the drill-ground, some four miles away, and we
would do our exercises and be home by eleven
or twelve. We never practised any attacks in
massed formation, we were always sent forward
in open lines. One of our officers had captured
a Russian position by making the men crawl
towards the enemy one at a time. He had taken
the position with the loss of only eight wounded.
We used to curse this officer from the bottom of
our hearts. Crawling is terribly hard work,
especially when you are in full kit, and still more
so when you have to go through whatever mud,
dirt, or puddles lie in your way. So many lives
had been lost at the front by people being afraid
to dirty their uniforms, that we were told to get
ours very dirty. And to have a foul-mouthed
peasant of a corporal shouting insults at you
while you are wriggling in the mud, makes you
feel a very worm.</p>

<p>From eleven to two we were free. From two
to three we had “instruktion,” that is to say,
some portion of the Infantryman’s Manual was
explained to us. Four times out of five the
subject was the duty of patrols. We were<span id="Page_51" class="pagenum">[51]</span>
supposed to know all this off by heart. Patrols were
considered so important that everything else was
subordinated to them in “instruktion.” Generally
the instructor was so tired of the subject that he
used to amuse us by stories of the war, or of the
pranks he used to play when he was a young
recruit twenty years before. If everything else
failed, the half-witted Alsatian was dragged out
and tortured to make a German holiday. After
“instruktion” came two hours more. These
were employed either in the drawing-room games
I have already mentioned, or in gymnastics, or in
sighting-exercises; that is to say, for two hours
on end we had to practise sighting our rifles in
the three positions&mdash;standing, kneeling, lying. I
have seen the way the Russian soldier was taught
these things, and I should say the Russian was
beyond comparison better trained than the
German. The Russian targets were much better,
much more like the real thing, and much more
care was taken. Sometimes the route-march and
the exercises took place at night, in which case
we had a slack morning. All our marching was
made to assimilate as near as possible to war
conditions. Our knapsacks were filled with sand,
and the weight of our equipment was about what
we had to bear in the field (75 lbs.). Our great
lack was in service rifles. Most of us had rifles
captured from the Russians, and great big heavy
things they are, too. For some time, indeed, I<span id="Page_52" class="pagenum">[52]</span>
had a rifle which bore the date 1820, and had
probably been made in England. The strain of
these exercises was severe, and I must confess
that I was never so tired at the front as I was
sometimes at home.</p>

<p>In one respect they had the advantage of
probably any army in the world&mdash;in the songs
they sang. Not only was the whole wealth of
the German “Volkslied” open to us, but the
special soldiers’ songs, “O Strassburg,” or “Ich
hatt’ ein’ kameraden,” are all of good quality,
while one (“Die drei Lilien”) is superb. These
songs provided me with unforgettable experiences.
I have already mentioned how the Alsatians used
to sing “O Strassburg.” It seemed as if they
could express themselves in no other way but by
singing that. Although I had lived in Germany
for many years, I never understood what a
“Volkslied” was till I heard the soldiers sing.
They were all peasants, and the impulse which
created the ballad never seems to have died out
in their class. They sang “Die drei Lilien,” a
ballad of high imaginative power, with the most
intimate understanding. Indeed, every time they
sang one of the old songs it seemed like a fresh
creation. And all the while new songs are being
composed, and the various joys and woes of a
soldier’s life are receiving an expression that is
nearly always striking and effective. The stuff
composed during the war itself, however, was<span id="Page_53" class="pagenum">[53]</span>
beginning to show the influence of the music-hall
and was getting to be desperately vulgar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SERGEANT-MAJOR</div>

<p>I think we should all have been a very happy
family if it had not been for the company sergeant-major.
This personage is the greatest power in
the company. He may be rude to the captain,
but the captain dare not be rude to him; for if
he is, things begin to go wrong in the company,
headquarters get to know of it, and the reprimand
falls, not on the company sergeant-major, but on
the captain. Our man took a special pleasure in
making us feel his power. His great sport was
to get men sent to the front. He would make
the lives of the other N.C.O.s such a hell to
them that in wild desperation they would volunteer
for active service long before their time.
His favourite trick with the rank and file was to
spoil their Sundays. The captain would sign
our leave-tickets for Sunday, but as soon as his
back was turned, the sergeant-major would take
them all and throw them into the waste-paper
basket. If the captain was away, he would fix
a parade for 2.30 on Sunday afternoon. Punctually
to time he would send some one to see if
we were all there; but the great man himself
would not appear till an hour or two later. Then
we might be sent home, but far too late for the
married men to collect their wives and children
and get to their favourite coffee-garden in the
suburbs. And all this was done with such an<span id="Page_54" class="pagenum">[54]</span>
<a id="Ref_54">insolent expression of mocking pity</a> on his face,
that I sometimes wondered that we did not club
him with our rifles. If he ever went to the front
at last, I am certain he was shot in the back by
his own men before he had been there long.</p>

<p>My experiences allowed me to test the real
estimation in which a soldier is held. On duty
we all had to wear the same sort of uniform.
When we were off duty we could wear a better
sort, if we chose, made for us by our own tailor.
Going home through the streets in my dirty
service uniform taught me a good deal. All
well-dressed people gave me a very wide berth.
I got home, bathed and changed into my private
uniform. It would be ungallant to say what a
difference it made. But in time of war I would
allow no flapper on the streets of a garrison town
except in a strait waistcoat and a muzzle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE GERMAN ARMY IN THE FIELD</span></h2>
</div>


<p>I intend in this chapter to relate what I heard
about the course of the war from the soldiers
themselves. I came to know much that was
interesting, and I think that most of what I have
to say will be new to English readers.</p>

<p>The German soldier was trained in time of
peace to be good at marching and in attack. A
resolute and aggressive spirit was cultivated by
every means known to such students of the psychology
of war as the Germans have always
proved themselves to be. Defensive measures
were almost completely ignored. The digging of
trenches, for example, was practised only once or
twice in a soldier’s two years of training. Long
forced marches under the conditions of actual
warfare were frequent, and every year a number
of men died through neglecting the precautions
enjoined upon them as necessary in these marches.
Even accuracy in shooting was made less of than
endurance on the road. The soldiers were,
moreover, deliberately made to go about their
duties mechanically and to acquire the habit of
doing things without asking the reason why. I
remember that some German soldiers were much<span id="Page_56" class="pagenum">[56]</span>
amused when they heard that English officers
gave themselves the trouble at manœuvres to explain
to their men exactly what was taking place.
Although this system of training was the rule, it
was not universal in Germany. General von
Haeseler was strongly opposed to it. Himself
impatient of authority, he endeavoured to instil
into his soldiers a spirit of responsibility and self-reliance.
After the war broke out, the High
Command saw how much better results had been
achieved by French and English methods of
developing the individual soldier, and Haeseler’s
ideals were adopted throughout Germany. Our
instructors used rather to bore us by continually
harping on “individual responsibility,” and reminding
us that the fate of the army depended
on the private soldier’s ability to stand alone and
act for himself when no officer was present.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war, then, Germany
had an army of good marchers, overflowing with
aggressive spirit, its great masses trained to work
together with mechanical perfection. She threw
the bulk of the army against France and used two
small portions of it to conquer Belgium and to
hold the Russians in check. For the first three
weeks of the war Germany was only bluffing in
Belgium and Russia. Less than forty thousand
men sufficed to take Liége. The town was won
not so much by the big artillery as by the marching
power of the infantry. Tunnels and bridges<span id="Page_57" class="pagenum">[57]</span>
had been blown up and the line, wherever possible,
destroyed. It was a race against time, in which
the railway could not be used. The soldiers had
to press forward by forced marches, and they
described to me how, in order to lighten their
steps, they threw away everything they could
spare&mdash;knapsacks, bread bags, mantles, and
trenching tools. Some even got rid of their
tunics and marched in their shirt-sleeves. For
miles and miles the roads were lined with the
cast-off effects of the German soldiers. Many
men could not keep up and fell fainting or dying
by the wayside. Whatever opposition they encountered
had to be crushed at once, regardless of
cost. The slaughter was immense, one regiment
being reduced to five hundred men by the time
Liége was taken. In this case, at any rate, the
training which the German soldier had received
was justified by results. At the beginning of the
war nothing seemed too wild and impossible for
the German soldier to attempt. The tradition of
audacity engendered in the army was always
bringing in splendid prizes. At Namur, a lieutenant
and four men bluffed into surrender the
principal fort with its entire garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BELGIUM</div>

<p>The system had other aspects. I do not intend
to discuss the terrorization of Belgium here,
except to say that the worst allegations of the
Allies are fully borne out by the tales the German
soldiers relate to one another. Man after man<span id="Page_58" class="pagenum">[58]</span>
has told me how, when he was in Belgium, he
used to fill Feldpostpakete with jewellery and
send them home. Looting was frequent, unashamed,
and not reproved by those in command.
The tales of murder were just as numerous.
Children knee-high were killed, women and girls
driven into a house, which was then set on fire,
and they were deliberately burned alive. The
Germans had a peculiar liking for humiliating
their victims before killing them. The condemned
were nearly always made to dig their
own graves. I heard one particularly touching
story of a girl. She had shot a German officer;
the reason was not stated, but it may be guessed.
She was sentenced to be executed next morning.
When she came out to her death, her face showed
that she had spent the night in dreadful agony of
soul. And yet the soldiers insulted her and
clubbed her with their rifles before shooting her.
Educated men used to feel shame at times. One
such wrote home to his mother in a fit of remorse
and described how, before shooting a French
officer, he had made him put on his coat inside
out. His mother was beside herself. “How
could my son,” she said, “do a thing like that?”</p>

<p>Another man told me about his experiences at
Louvain. I give his words exactly. “We were
sitting round the table in our room. Suddenly
shots fell and some bullets whizzed past our heads
and buried themselves in the wall opposite. The<span id="Page_59" class="pagenum">[59]</span>
lieutenant said, ‘Put out the light, somebody.’
This we did. ‘Go out into the street, and wherever
you see a Belgian or wherever you see a light in
a house, shoot.’” The tale speaks for itself. The
lieutenant had not the slightest evidence that the
shots had come from the Belgians. This same
soldier told me that from the first they had orders
to give no quarter to the English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRANCE</div>

<p>I heard similar tales of rapine, arson, and
murder in France. One army corps, I think
it was the tenth, was especially famous for its
record in these things. Villages were burned
as a matter of course, without any military reason.
Sheer savage lust of destruction was the motive
and nothing else. The men of this corps were
proud of what they had done and were regarded
by the others with envy.</p>

<p>It was interesting to speak with those who
had been at the Marne. They were unanimous
in asserting that they had not been defeated, but
had retired of their own free will. Some even
spoke of having spontaneously retreated ninety
kilometres in one day. The general opinion in
the German Army was that the failure on the
Marne was due to the Saxons. They could not
march so well as the Prussians. The pace had
been too much for them, so they had given up and
left their comrades in the lurch. Others accounted
for it by saying that just in the nick of time the
Italians let the French know that they need not<span id="Page_60" class="pagenum">[60]</span>
guard the Italian frontier. Whereupon all the
army corps in the South of France were suddenly
thrown into the battle and their appearance turned
the scale. But of Joffre as a factor that counted
in the battle of the Marne there was never a word.</p>

<p>There were many complaints at the beginning
of the war about the quality of the reserve officers.
From not one but from several regiments I used
to hear strange stories about the difficulties these
men got their regiments into. On a certain occasion
in the Vosges, the Germans had to retire, and
their commander, an officer of the reserve, thought
it a great thing to lead them into a kind of little
pocket or basin in the forest. The French, however,
knew these hills perfectly, and were well
aware that that was the only place where troops
could find shelter. They swept it with a storm of
shell and left scarcely a man alive. In the early
days the mortality among the subalterns was
horrible. Later on they were not expected to
lead their company to the attack, but to go behind
the first line or “wave.”</p>

<p>We used to have rare thrills in Bonn during
the great fights. Officers were able to telephone
straight from the field of battle to their families at
home. You might sit in your study and exchange
the time of the day with a friend in the trenches.
It was not allowed officially, but it was done.
Officers might telegraph if there was any important
business to settle. So families in Bonn were<span id="Page_61" class="pagenum">[61]</span>
continually receiving this sort of telegram: “Buy
10,000 war stock,” “By all means sell the house.”
This did not mean that the Frau Hauptmann
was to engage in these transactions really; it only
meant that on the date the wire was dispatched,
its sender was alive and well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUSSIA</div>

<p>The Russian campaigns, like the Belgian, were
won by bluff and good marching. In August,
1914, East Prussia was held by only a thin screen
of troops, mostly Landsturm. But in order to
deceive the enemy, trenches were dug and filled
with dummy machine-guns and with scarecrows
wearing the spiked helmets of the German infantry.
In another district a division was employed
for some time simply in marching between
two points. In the daytime it marched from A to
B, at night it entrained and was sent back to A,
changed the numbers on its helmets and shoulder-straps
and marched to B again. The Russians
were thus led to believe that certain parts of the
line were strongly held and that at other points a
great concentration of troops was taking place.
But for this they would have attempted a breakthrough
and might really have reached Berlin.
They were still more elaborately fooled at the
winter battle of the Masurian Lakes. Here the
Germans wanted to lure the Russians a second
time into this dangerous territory. One would
have thought it impossible, but the trap was set
with masterly cunning. Reports appeared, not so<span id="Page_62" class="pagenum">[62]</span>
much in the German as in the neutral papers, that
East Prussia was being evacuated and that the
peasants were leaving their homesteads and
villages and fleeing westwards in a wild panic.
The Germans, it was hinted, were so occupied in
France that they could not spare any troops for
the Russian front. Meanwhile, whatever forces
the Germans had, seemed to be concentrated
opposite Warsaw. The Russians fell headlong
into the trap and lost the flower of what was left
of their old army. Neither battle of the Masurian
Lakes could have been won except for the marching
powers of the German infantry. While the
enemy was held in front, it was necessary to march
round with extreme swiftness and take him in
the rear before he could begin to move his armies
out of the trap. The soldiers who took part in
this battle told me that the forced marches tried
them beyond anything they had experienced in
the war.</p>

<p>On the whole, the German training found its
best justification in Russia. Here the conditions
were exactly those for which it had been devised.
The enemy was superior in numbers, and he was
to be overawed by German dash, enterprise, and
mobility. The principle in Russia was to go for
the enemy wherever you found him, and to count
neither his numbers nor your losses. The Russian
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</i> was badly shaken. Our servant at Irkutsk,
who had fought against the Germans, used to<span id="Page_63" class="pagenum">[63]</span>
wake us by shouting in his dreams, “The Germans
are coming. Run! Run!” In time the Germans
came to despise the Russians so much that they
neglected the most obvious precautions. Our
regiment once advanced to the attack without
even reconnoitring the ground. When halfway
across to the enemy’s positions, they were suddenly
held up by a sunken ditch. They had to go forward
as best they could, and the leading company
alone lost eighty killed.</p>

<p>But with all their dash the Germans would
have been lost without their superiority in artillery.
They had plenty of guns and plenty of ammunition,
and could always batter the Russian trenches
to pieces before attacking. The Russians, on the
other hand, could only fire a limited number of
shells per day, and were practically helpless against
a bombardment. Most people will remember that
some time in October or November, 1914, Hindenburg
was surrounded by the Russians. He afterwards
broke the ring, taking 12,000 prisoners with
him. He owed his release solely to the heavy
artillery, to which the Russians could not reply.
One man who took part in the battle said to me,
“We began to batter a sector of the Russian line
at eight o’clock in the morning, and by the evening
we were through.”</p>

<p>The system of attack in massed formation,
common to both the Germans and the Austrians,
was most heartily disliked by the younger officers.<span id="Page_64" class="pagenum">[64]</span>
They used to protest against it, but in vain. On
one occasion a regiment had received an order
to attack, and its adjutant telephoned to headquarters,
“Attack impossible. Clear field of fire.”
He received the answer, “Doesn’t matter. Go
forward.” He did so, and not a man came back,
except the wounded. Sometimes the men themselves
took matters into their own hands. We
were once attacking a Russian village, and were
met by a hurricane of shrapnel and bullets.
Fifteen times the bugle sounded the charge, and
fifteen times not a man stirred from where he lay.
At last the artillery came up, and the Russians
retired. The losses entailed by mass attacks were
staggering. At the first battle of Ypres the Germans
lost 120,000 men. As I have mentioned,
when I was trained, the Germans were beginning
to see reason, and were taught to go forward in
open formation.</p>

<p>In the Austrian Army, while things were
similar, discipline was looser and protest more
easy. One officer, when ordered to a hopeless
attack, refused point blank. “Very well, then,”
said the general, “if you don’t attack, I shall
turn the guns on you.” The officer replied that
if the general did that, he would order his men
to right-about-turn and take the guns. The
general gave in, and the officer received neither
reprimand nor punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RED CROSS</div>

<p>The worst organized part of the German Army<span id="Page_65" class="pagenum">[65]</span>
was the Red Cross work. From all I could hear,
it seems that the German Red Cross arrangements
badly broke down in the first year of the
war. At first I thought the complaints I heard
were exaggerations, but the same story came from
every part of the front. The stretcher-bearers
were all said to be cowards, for ever lurking about
in the rear, not daring to face a bullet. Besides
they were selfish thieves, and they drank all the
cognac themselves, which they were supposed to
reserve for the wounded. “Why,” the soldiers
used to say, “even the Russians have organized
their Red Cross better than we. Their stretcher-bearers
do go forward with the soldiers in the
front line.” These complaints received some confirmation
from the fact that a cavalry lieutenant
of my acquaintance was transferred to the medical
corps in order to organize the stretcher-bearers
and see if he could not get them to face the music
of the shells. Wherever I went at the front, the
stretcher-bearers were treated with contempt by
the other soldiers. What I say does not apply to
the doctors, I never heard anything against them.</p>

<p>Again, at the beginning, the distribution of
comforts left much to be desired. At one time
on the French front you could buy a horse for
two cigars. Later on the supply of tobacco was
improved. Of religious work, or Y.M.C.A. work,
there was comparatively little. The Germans
had a brilliant idea for fighting venereal disease.<span id="Page_66" class="pagenum">[66]</span>
When a soldier fell ill, they sent his nearest
relative a postcard to the effect that your son
(husband, brother, as the case might be) was at
“Hospital No. so-and-so, suffering from so-and-so.”
Shame kept many straight, when nothing
else would have prevailed.</p>

<p>The accounts which the Germans gave of their
enemies were interesting. They freely admitted
that the French and English were better at flying
than they. Of Russian aviators they thought
nothing. On the other hand, every one had the
greatest respect for the Russian artillery. It was
the universal opinion that the Russian artillerymen
were the smartest in the war. One German
officer said to me, “If we had the Russian artillery
we should be in Kieff by now.” At a certain
point on the Russian front we had half a battery&mdash;two
guns&mdash;opposed to us. Yet so quickly did
the Russians fire them off, boom, boom, boom,
boom, that we thought they had a battery of four
guns. And when the statements of prisoners
placed it beyond a doubt that there were only
two guns, our artillery were lost in wonder, and
said that they themselves could not attempt such
a thing. Of the Russian troops, the Cossack
enjoyed a great reputation as a scout, but he was
a poor fighter. The Austrians, who were in the
disastrous retreat from Rava Ruska, told me
wonderful tales of the Cossack cleverness in
scouting. They would scarcely come within a<span id="Page_67" class="pagenum">[67]</span>
kilometre of the position, and yet they would
have noticed exactly how it ran, and the Russian
artillery would soon confirm the accuracy of their
reconnoitring. The Germans had an unbounded
admiration for the French soldiers. It was the
fashion to pity the French for having such a
splendid army, but such a poor Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH ARMY</div>

<p>But, of course, I was chiefly interested in
hearing their views about the English troops.
Before they met them, the Germans were full of
contempt. English soldiers were hirelings, and
certainly could not stand up to such troops as
the Germans. A week’s fighting sufficed to bring
round their opinion to the exact opposite. Every
English private, they said, fights like a sergeant
and shoots like Buffalo Bill. In every branch of
warfare they used to acknowledge the superiority
of the Old Army. “Each single Englishman has
to be dug out separately,” they said. When
Russians were captured, whole armies at a time,
they used to get impatient. “What is the use
of that,” they said. “A thousand Russians are
equal to ten Frenchmen and one Englishman.”
Our colonel, in a speech he made to the regiment
in May, 1915, said, “In a few months, perhaps
weeks, we shall have finished with the Russians,
but,” and here he turned to me, “I don’t think
we shall ever get finished with your country.”
I need scarcely say that I altogether dissociate
myself from this estimate of Russian and French<span id="Page_68" class="pagenum">[68]</span>
troops. The battles which broke the Austrian
front at Rava Ruska in 1914, and the victories
of Brusiloff in 1916, were among the most brilliant
operations in the war. The French soldier it
would be impertinent for me to praise, except
perhaps to say that this war has added fresh
glory to an army which already had the most
splendid traditions of any in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN PRISONS</div>

<p>And finally comes the subject of the treatment
of prisoners. The evidence as to Russian
prisoners is conflicting. Cossacks received no
quarter; they were always killed. I have heard
many vile stories on this point; let one suffice.
Once two hundred Cossacks were caught and
told to line up with their faces to Russia. They
were very glad, and thought they were going to
be exchanged. Then, without a word being said,
a machine-gun was turned on them from behind,
and they were all shot. There are stories of
great cruelty to other Russian prisoners, Hindenburg
being especially prominent in this. When
Russian prisoners were quarrelling in their
barracks, he had the artillery turned on them,
“to quiet them,” as he said. For further stories
of this kind I need only refer to the official papers
of the Tsar’s Government. On the other hand,
I know that the Germans wanted to keep the
Russian workmen in Germany after the war in
order that they should take the place of the men
Germany had lost on the battlefield. The Russian<span id="Page_69" class="pagenum">[69]</span>
labourers were said to learn quickly, and to do a
good day’s work when under German direction.
Employers had the strictest orders to show every
kindness to their Russian prisoners. I had a
talk with an escaped prisoner of war, and he had
nothing but good to say of his treatment in Germany.
He praised the order, punctuality, and
cleanliness of German life, and was determined
to go back there after the war. It is possible
that those prisoners who were willing to work
were better treated than the others who stayed
in the camps. A doctor who had lived in the
prison camps, and who had been exchanged, gave
the most terrible account of the treatment which
the Russians received there. He said they were
worst treated of all, because the Russian Government
were so slow in taking reprisals; while the
English were the best treated, because our
Government were the promptest in reprisals.
This referred to the year 1916, while Mr. Asquith
was still Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The Germans used captivity for political purposes.
They would throw French, Belgian, and
English together, and then issue gleeful reports
that these “Allies” were always fighting. From
my experience of prison life I know exactly how
this was done, because the Russians tried the
same methods on us. You have only to pamper
the French and to starve the English, and the
mischief is done. A starving man is an irritable<span id="Page_70" class="pagenum">[70]</span>
man, and it takes a slight thing to make him an
angry one.</p>

<p>With regard to the treatment of English
prisoners I have no first-hand information. From
the very beginning rumours were rife in Bonn
that they were being badly used. These stories
were told with great satisfaction, as if it were right
to do so. The Germans themselves used to relate
how English prisoners were incited by cruelty to
revolt so as to have an excuse for shooting them.
German soldiers used to tell me how naïve the
English soldiers were. “When they were taken
prisoners they wanted to shake hands and be
friends. And they had just been killing our men,
too. We always used to give them a good drubbing
with the butt-end of our rifles. It is what
they deserved for killing Germans.” Let me add
that at Cassel I met a German soldier who had
been captured by the English and exchanged.
He was full of gratitude for the kindness he had
received. His captors gave him of their best
before passing him on to the rear. When their
transport reached Southampton station, a Red
Cross nurse asked the officer if she might be
allowed to give them some refreshment, and permission
was readily granted. At Netley he had
been much better off than at Cassel. There had
been plenty to eat and drink, and, what was more,
you could always help yourselves too.</p>

<p>The German is an inordinately vain man, and<span id="Page_71" class="pagenum">[71]</span>
he likes to impress people (“imponiren,” he calls
it). The English soldiers refused to be impressed.
Their hard, indomitable temper filled
the Germans with envy and despair, and the more
brutal among them went to the utmost lengths in
the endeavour to break the spirit of our men. I
only once saw an English prisoner. It was at
Cassel. He had been taken ill on a working-party,
and was walking back to his camp. As
he passed through our ranks, he bore himself
with downcast eyes indeed, but with such pride
and dignity that we all seemed to be mere recruits,
and he the only true soldier present.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">At the Front</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">EQUIPMENT</div>

<p>Well, then, in the middle of August, 1915, we
started for the Russian front. Our equipment
even at that time was so bad that I am surprised
Germany has held out so long. My tunic was
made of shoddy; it tore easily and cockled up
most pitifully in the rain. Leather was scarce in
Germany and had to be quickly tanned, so what
we received was inferior in quality and soon
perished. Our helmets were of a variety of materials,
some of aluminium, some of cardboard,
but none of the good stout leather that was used
before the war. The “pickelhaube,” as the spiked
helmet is called, is the only good point about the
German uniform. It is delightfully cool and airy<span id="Page_72" class="pagenum">[72]</span>
in summer, and so flexible that it will fit any shape
of head. The rest of the German uniform is an
abomination of discomfort. The round fatigue-caps,
besides giving one the appearance of a convict,
are hot and oppressive, as no ventilation is
possible in them at all. The tunic has every fault
such a garment could have. It is made not only
to button close, but to hook tight round the neck.
When you are on the march and have the heavy
knapsack pulling at the coat, and so making the
throttle more painful still, the strain becomes
almost unbearable. We were never allowed to
unhook the collar on the march except when we
had special orders to do so. There are only two
pockets in front, and two others in the tail of the
coat. This means that when you are in full uniform
it is almost impossible to get at these pockets,
and, as the soldier spends so much time lying
about on the ground, the things you put there
nearly always get broken. The army knee-boots
are instruments of torture. They are roughly
made, and are full of unevennesses of surface that
rub painful sores, while the folds that form about
the ankles are equally uncomfortable. They were
stuffy in summer, heavy, and a serious impediment
to quick movement. Low boots and puttees are
infinitely preferable. Some of us wished to go to
the front in low boots and leggings, but on account
of the shortage of leather this was forbidden.
Leggings could only be worn by officers. I had<span id="Page_73" class="pagenum">[73]</span>
a pair of knee-boots made for me of fine smooth
leather, but even then, under ideal conditions, they
were anything but comfortable. In addition, we
had to carry in our knapsacks a pair of low boots, to
act as “slippers”; that is to say, to be worn to ease
our feet when we were off duty. It was found,
when we arrived at the front, that most of us had
thrown these boots away rather than be bothered
with their extra weight. German soldiers thought
that the English kit was very much better than
theirs. They were amused because every English
soldier was provided with a razor. Even officers
told me that it was folly to shave at the front.</p>

<p>We received our clothes with many jokes,
which may, or may not, be usual in other armies.
“Now then, be careful there with my grave-clothes.
What am I to be buried in, if you go
spoiling them already?” Witticisms of this sort
were frequent. The German soldier is not the
least squeamish about speaking of death. His
songs are full of it. And the little books of devotion
issued by his Government are written with
great skill in order to make him feel that death is
something pleasant and light, the entrance to a
life of toilless ease. I never read these books
without feeling an inclination to die then and there.</p>

<p>We marched off to the station in traditional
German style, flowers in our rifles, flowers in our
helmets, flowers in every nook and cranny of our
uniform that would take a flower. The officers<span id="Page_74" class="pagenum">[74]</span>
used to protest against this, saying that it made
us look like prize oxen at the fair. Considering
what the fate of prize oxen is, the simile was not
altogether inapt. In any case, the fashion suited
the peasant taste. Before we left, a short religious
service was held on the parade-ground. The
chaplain, who had already been awarded the Iron
Cross, had gained my respect a few weeks before
by a sermon he had preached to order on the
special temptations of a soldier’s life. It was the
only sermon of the kind that I have heard, which
neither offended his hearers’ feelings nor in any
other way violated the rules of good taste. But
he was yet to show what he could do. At the end
of the service he said, with indescribable unction,
“Now let us all join in saying the Lord’s Prayer,
and after that in singing, ‘Deutschland, Deutschland
über alles!’”</p>

<p>There was a great parade of secrecy about
our destination. We were not supposed to know
where we were going, and from the time we were
selected for service we were not allowed to telegraph.
As a matter of fact, the officials responsible
revealed all that they ought to have kept
secret, and we knew exactly for what part of the
huge Russian front we were bound and all the
details of our journey. And through us the whole
of Cassel knew too.</p>

<p>Our life for the next three or four weeks till
we reached our regiment was simply a jolly picnic.<span id="Page_75" class="pagenum">[75]</span>
We were three hundred strong, under the command
of two sergeants, genial fellows, who had
never been to the front and who were anything
but soldiers. Our train journey took us through
Central Germany to Breslau, and thence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viâ</i> Cracow
to a station beyond Rava Ruska, the name
of which I have forgotten. In High Germany
we were greeted with enthusiasm at every station,
in German Poland no one took any notice of us,
in Austrian Poland our reception was directly
hostile. The Austrians treated us like “matter
in the wrong place.” We reached Cracow at ten
at night, and were to have had supper there.
Nothing had been got ready for us and no one
knew anything about us. We stood waiting in
the rain for two hours, and then we had to pass in
single file before a small window and each receive
his basin of soup. At Kattowitz, the last German
station, our transport, now swelled to a thousand
men, had been fed in less than half an hour. The
Austrians were sulky at having to trouble about
us and took no pains to conceal their feelings, and
the Germans were wild with rage at the way they
were treated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUSTRIANS</div>

<p>This is, perhaps, the best place to speak of the
relations between the Germans and the Austrians.
There have been many discussions in the press as
to whom the Germans hate most, whether it is the
English or the Americans. I have no doubt at all
that the German soldier hates the Austrian most.<span id="Page_76" class="pagenum">[76]</span>
They felt themselves betrayed from the beginning
of the war. When the Russians broke through at
Rava Ruska, Hindenburg sent down an officer
to find out what was wrong. He returned with
the report: “Da ist eine bodenlose Schweinerei,
wir werden alles selbst machen müssen” (“Things
are in no end of a mess; we shall have to do
everything ourselves”). Hindenburg used to allow
himself witticisms at the expense of his Allies.
Once he remarked, “I won’t have anything said
against my Austrians. They serve to occupy the
enemy till the military come up.” Stories were
current of Prussian officers serving on the Austrian
staff, who had discovered Austrian generals in the
very act of telephoning to the enemy and had
shot them dead on the spot. Meanwhile the
Germans, by their behaviour, let the Austrians
know that they remembered all these things. It
was most amusing to watch Austrians attempting
to fraternize with Germans. The Austrian, with
his gay and careless elegance of manner, would
approach the German and try to get into conversation
with him. Most probably he would begin by
asking where the other came from. The German
would draw himself up stiff and straight till he
looked as if he had swallowed the poker, and
would put on an air as if he concentrated in his
own person all the victorious majesty of his army.
Then, in the sharp staccato dear to the Prussian
drill-sergeant, he would answer, “Ich bin aus<span id="Page_77" class="pagenum">[77]</span>
Cassel, Regierungsbezirk Cassel” (as who should
say, “I am from Nottingham, Nottinghamshire”).
The Austrian, recognizing the case as hopeless,
would give him up with an amused glance and
turn to something else. Meanwhile the German,
having just wit enough to see that he was being
laughed at but far too stupid to see what there
was ridiculous about him, would go away, heaping
fresh curses on the head of “Bruder Oesterreich”
(Brother Austria).</p>

<p>The Austrian, if possible, hated the German
just as bitterly. While we were on the march,
we met an Austrian army corps going in the
opposite direction. The officers deliberately rode
their horses at us in order to edge us into the
muddy parts of the road. It is significant that
although we were some hours in contact with this
army corps, we never exchanged a single greeting
or taunt, such as is usual among soldiers meeting
on the march. While it is true that there was much
that was rotten in the Austrian Army, it must never
be forgotten that some regiments fought magnificently,
especially the Tyrolese. A common soldier
of the Tyrol Rifles was wounded and taken prisoner
by the Russians. As he lay in hospital, a
general, making his rounds, came to his bed. On
hearing who he was, the Russian general took off
his helmet and saluted the Austrian private in
honour of the splendid courage displayed by his
regiment in the field.</p>

<p><span id="Page_78" class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>The Austrians were in an unfortunate position,
because their relations with the Hungarians were
just as strained as with the Germans. The Hungarians,
on the other hand, were extremely friendly
with the Germans. They were good fighters in
hand-to-hand fighting, indeed the most formidable
troops in the armies of the Central Powers. They
had never failed the Germans, who, in consequence,
always treated them with especial respect.
Prince Eitel Friedrich had at one time been
studying Hungarian with a view, it was said,
of becoming King of Hungary. The Austrians
watched all these things with bitter jealousy and
suspicion. They would affect to despise the
Hungarian, and would tell you that he was not
a European yet at all, and that Asia began at
Buda-Pesth. The Hungarians never concealed
their contempt of the Austrians. They did not
value the union with Austria; all they wanted
was an alliance with Germany. Three years ago
Hungarian officers were openly talking of the
coming revolution that was to drive the Hapsburgs
out, make Hungary free, and to draw
Hungary and Germany closer together.</p>

<p>On our journey we had plenty of opportunity
to study Austrian feeling. The train took us
through Galicia, and we passed the famous battlefields
(now, alas! forgotten) of 1914-15, Jaroslav,
the San, Rava Ruska, and so on. The large
towns seemed to be in fairly good preservation,<span id="Page_79" class="pagenum">[79]</span>
but in the country there was nothing but ruin and
desolation. The fields were empty, and what
peasants we saw scowled at us with hate. The
hostility of the people we were supposed to be
fighting for made a deeper impression upon us
than the distress caused by the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE MARCH</div>

<p>We detrained and began a march in pursuit
of our regiment, which lasted three weeks. The
Russians were in retreat, the regiment pushed
forward, and we had to follow after as best we
could. Our way took us to Cholm, across the
Bug at Wlodawa, then to Kobrin, and thence
southwards among the marshes, where we struck
the regiment at last. It was a jolly time. We
had perfect weather, sunshine all day, but the air
was bracing and fresh; it seemed impossible to get
tired in that climate. We marched from eight to
twelve, halted for the day, cooked our meals, bathed
or walked about, and went to bed at nine. It reminded
me very much of the continually recurring
sentence in Xenophon: “We marched X parasangs
and had breakfast.” We tried to do twenty
kilometres (about fourteen miles) a day, and every
four or five days we had one day’s complete rest.
Wherever possible, we put up for the night at the
country houses of the Polish nobles, because they
had orchards that gave us apples and kitchen
gardens that gave us potatoes. The houses were
completely gutted, not a stick of furniture was
left, and they were often defiled in the most<span id="Page_80" class="pagenum">[80]</span>
disgusting manner. When we had no meat, we
took from the peasants what we wanted. We paid
by giving them a sham “bon,” with the reverse
(eagle) side of a ten-pfennig piece rubbed in.
They saw the eagle and thought it something
wonderful, although it was quite valueless. Sometimes
a cow would be shot and its flesh immediately
cut up, and, still warm and trembling, be
distributed among us to make soup of. All our
peasants and labourers could cook, and they despised
the educated men because they did not
know what to do with the meat they received.
I was three hours frying my first steak; nothing
I could think of made any impression on it, and
it remained obstinately leathery. The next time
a “Kamerad” showed me how to beat it tender
with the blade of my bayonet, and, lo! the steak
was fried in ten minutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN POLAND</div>

<p>We had an interesting three days’ stay at
Cholm. There was a cholera camp here, at
which it was said seventeen German soldiers died
a day. The whole country from the San to the
Bug was devastated with cholera. Cholm also
had a dysentery hospital where the patients were
so numerous that they had to lie about on the
ground for days before they could be attended to.
German order ruled in the town. Notices were
posted up that only certain wells could be used,
and bakers were especially warned about the
water they took for baking. The attitude of the<span id="Page_81" class="pagenum">[81]</span>
population was instructive. The Russians hated
us, the Poles were afraid of us, the Jews received
us with open arms. The German Government
had already begun an extensive propaganda.
Local newspapers had been founded which should
bring the people round to Germany’s side. They
certainly made some impression on the Jews, if
on no one else. At Cholm the only good
restaurant was strictly reserved for the use of
officers. For us there remained a few dirty
Jewish eating-houses. Y.M.C.A. huts or clubs
would have been very welcome because we had
nothing to do all day, and time hung very heavy
on our hands. I consider it one of the greatest
successes in the war that this side of a soldier’s
life was so well looked after by the English and
the French.</p>

<p>When we were not in the towns, we used to
spend the time very happily. All the golden
afternoons we used to bathe in the rivers or lakes
and then run up and down in the bright sunshine to
get dry. At times the whole village&mdash;men, women,
girls, and children&mdash;would turn out to watch us.
We were more puzzled than embarrassed at these
attentions. There was something about them we
could not account for. At last we heard that
their popes had told them that every German
soldier was a veritable devil with horns, hoofs,
and tail complete, and they had come out to see
with their own eyes whether it was so or not.</p>

<p><span id="Page_82" class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>Almost every day we saw the site of some
skirmish, and near by would be a little group of
graves with wooden crosses bearing the names of
the fallen. We would thus keep the track of our
regiment, and often would find the names of those
we knew among the dead. At last we reached
the front. In the three weeks march, of three
hundred who left Cassel, one hundred had already
dropped out through sickness. All the Jews and
all the Alsatians, with one exception, had drunk
themselves into dysentery. If in a cholera country
you go on drinking well water unboiled, you are
sure to get dysentery sooner or later. When we
arrived at the headquarters of the regiment, we
had to undergo three formal receptions. The
major commanding the regiment, the captain
commanding the battalion, the lieutenant commanding
the company, each delivered a speech,
but the only thing that did us any good was the
quiet little heart-to-heart talk the company
sergeant-major had with us that evening before
going to bed. Apparently the last set of recruits
had proved unsatisfactory. They had even taken
to stealing things out of their comrades’ knapsacks.
The law in our company was that you might take
anything that was not in a knapsack. It was the
man’s own fault, if he lost it, for leaving it lying
about. On the other hand, to steal out of a knapsack
was the unpardonable sin and was severely
punished. I do not know anything about the<span id="Page_83" class="pagenum">[83]</span>
code of morals in other armies, but I do know
this, the German working man will pilfer whenever
he can, and no feeling of shame or good
comradeship will restrain him. And the Socialism
with which he becomes indoctrinated in the army
makes it appear almost a virtue to steal from the
rich.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE MARCH</div>

<p>We belonged to a flying division, the function
of which was to pop in wherever things were going
badly. Our march was steadily southward and
we were destined, I believe, for Serbia. Usually
we fought all day and marched all night and slept
when we could. We were a crack regiment and
the utmost was expected of us. There was
scarcely any one in the company who had started
out with the regiment in 1914; half of us were
raw recruits, and even then we did not number
more than one hundred and twenty. Much is
said about the sternness of German discipline, but
there was little of it to be seen here. There was
rather a spirit of good understanding between
officers and men. The officers knew that they
could rely on their men, and the men trusted their
officers. The weak spot was the young lieutenant
commanding the company. He was nervous, excitable,
and wild in his plans, but it was acknowledged
that he looked after us very well and took
great pains to see that we were comfortable. The
strong point was the company sergeant-major,
who was said on countless occasions to have<span id="Page_84" class="pagenum">[84]</span>
rescued the company out of awkward positions
into which the impetuousness of the lieutenant
had led us. But perhaps that is said in all regiments.
In any case the sergeant-major gave
himself no trouble to conceal his opinion of the
lieutenant. I remember when we were in a forest
one dark night, the lieutenant ordered patrols to
be sent out in order to get into touch with another
battalion. Now, the forest was so dense that we
had lost ourselves in it by day; it was perfect
folly to dream of finding anybody in it at night.
The sergeant-major told us of the lieutenant’s
order with a flick of contempt in his voice, adding
that he was not going to send any of us out on
that wildgoose-chase. It seemed to me that he
nursed a grievance, because no commission had
been given him. He was the oldest officer in
the regiment, and as competent and clear-headed
as any one there, but he had not passed the
requisite examination at school. In any case, to
be ordered about by a mere chit of a boy went
very much against the grain. Cases of this sort
may explain the dramatic suddenness of the
revolution in the German Army. If the higher
N.C.O.s become infected by the prevailing discontents,
then farewell discipline and order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLUNDERING</div>

<p>I have often been asked if I witnessed any
atrocities at the front. I saw nothing to speak of,
but then I was there only a very short time.
Whatever stores of food the inhabitants had were<span id="Page_85" class="pagenum">[85]</span>
ruthlessly plundered. But there again a soldier
is allowed by the traditions of war to take whatever
he wants to eat wherever he finds it&mdash;in a
conquered country, at any rate. The plundering
was unnecessary in the majority of cases, we were
well enough fed, and the men simply took because
it was there to take. Often it meant black ingratitude.
A peasant and his wife would receive
us kindly in their house, make a fire for us, and
help us to cook. Then some one would begin to
search the house, and whatever could be carried
off, would be taken. One incident I shall never
forget. We had arrived at a village which was
still full of poultry. The men dispersed, taking
what they could. In one farmyard I saw a girl,
just in time, whip the two fattest hens under her
shawl. The men came up, demanding to know
where the poultry was. She stood there, pressing
the hidden birds to her bosom, mocking defiance
in her eyes, the picture of saucy courage. Then,
with a gesture of contempt, she indicated some
geese in the distance. The men, deeply grateful
to her, went off in pursuit. A tame goose-chase
does not sound very exciting, but is rather good
sport. You make a ring round the bird, and just
when you think you have got it, it rises in the
air and escapes you. The scene was suggestive&mdash;the
clumsy soldiers in their heavy boots perseveringly
stalking a goose, that every time
eluded them with ease&mdash;surely an apt emblem of<span id="Page_86" class="pagenum">[86]</span>
much in German life&mdash;and the girl, their muse
and inspirer, watching them with a contempt that
deepened till she seemed Disdain personified.</p>

<p>I did not see any instances of violation of the
rules of war in battle. The Austrians were often
to blame for the use of dum-dum bullets. They
had soft-nosed tracer bullets for finding the range,
but the common soldiers, as might have been
expected, did not restrict themselves to using
them for this purpose only. Once they shot away
whole cases full of this ammunition. The Russians
captured a battalion of Austrian infantry next
day, shot them all except one, and sent him back
to say what they had done and why.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRUTALITY</div>

<p>The thing which angered me most was the
brutal treatment of prisoners. Those kept just
behind the front were always hungry and in rags,
and yet they were made to work at tasks of great
severity. Thus I have seen Russian prisoners
hauling huge trees along the road. We invariably
greeted them with insult and jeers. One of the
favourite taunts to hurl at them was, “Nikolaus
entlaust” (“Nicholas has got rid of his lice”).
The common soldier had not a trace of chivalry
or generous feeling in him. The only one to protest
against this sort of thing was the Alsatian,
who tried in vain to bring his comrades round to
a humaner point of view.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the relations
between officers and men were good. In this<span id="Page_87" class="pagenum">[87]</span>
connection it is as well to say that those stories
one sometimes reads of German officers flogging
their men are quite impossible. It is unthinkable
that a German officer should hit a soldier. I have
never heard of its being done, and redress is so
quick and certain, that even if it had occurred by
mischance in any regiment, it could never have
become a regular practice. Brutality, however,
had plenty of opportunities to manifest itself. I
heard a story of two old school friends who had
a quarrel in the trenches. One was a private, the
other a corporal. Unfortunately the private forgot
himself and used bad language to his friend
the corporal. The latter immediately reports the
affair, the private is court-martialled and sentenced
to twelve years’ imprisonment. Before he is sent
away, the battalion is drawn up on parade, the
major in command lectures them on the heinousness
of the crime, spits at the criminal, and then,
turning his back on the men, says, “I now leave
you to do what you like with him.” They take
the hint and give him a good drubbing with the
butt-ends of their rifles. I do not think that
such a thing could have happened in our regiment,
but there was nothing in the regulations of
the army to prevent it.</p>

<p>Although the relations between officers and
men were good, those between the various social
classes among the common soldiers were very bad.
In England the war seems to have drawn the<span id="Page_88" class="pagenum">[88]</span>
classes together, they have come to understand
and respect one another. In the German Army
exactly the opposite has happened. Theoretically
from the moment war was declared, all classes
were equal in the army. Promotion was to be by
merit alone. In practice, the educated men were
marked out from the beginning for promotion, if
only they showed any promise at all, and they were
not only more quickly promoted, they could rise
higher, they could receive a commission. The
uneducated, no matter what his abilities, never
got beyond a sergeant. On this account the
“lower” classes bore the “upper” classes a
grudge, and did what they could to make their life
miserable. The educated men, on the other hand,
were disgusted by the continual thieving of the
working-man, his brutality, and his utter want of
comradeship. I know of no educated man in the
German Army whose thinking had not taken on an
anti-Socialist and pro-Conservative tendency as
the result of his experiences in the war. To know
the German labourer was not to respect him. My
experiences with the working-man were uniformly
wretched until almost the last, when I made the
acquaintance of some artisans at Irkutsk. These
men one could respect, and it was possible to form
such friendships with them as we read of in the
English Army. But then they belonged to the
aristocracy of labour, some of them had thriving
businesses of their own, and I do not think they<span id="Page_89" class="pagenum">[89]</span>
regarded themselves as ordinary labourers. Be
that as it may, from all that I could hear and see,
the war has greatly intensified the bitterness of
class feeling in Germany, inasmuch as it has
taught the different classes of society in the army
to hate and distrust one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE MARCH</div>

<p>For the rest, our life was like that of soldiers
in the classic wars of older times. There was
nothing in it of the terrors of modern battle which
made the Western Front so dreadful. We
marched and fought, pursuing an enemy that
retreated further and further and avoided a decisive
battle. It was warfare as Marlborough or
Napoleon knew it. The strategy was simple, and
the means of destruction were comparatively
simple&mdash;the bayonet, the rifle, the field-gun. Our
men affected to despise the Russians, but I noticed
that the longer they had been at the front, the
more they thought of the enemy. The Russians
neither harried nor pressed us, they simply gave
way. Provided only that they held Hindenburg
in the north round Riga, they were content to let
us take as much of the barren marshland of
Central Russia as we chose. This continual expectation
of a battle that never came strained our
nerves more than actual fighting did. I remember
once advancing on a Russian village, which was
situated on the top of a hill. We toiled upwards
in that tense and sultry mood which always precedes
action, each of us too occupied with his own<span id="Page_90" class="pagenum">[90]</span>
thoughts to speak. Further and further we
trudged, and after some time the sergeant behind
me began to point out where he thought the
Russian artillery must be posted. On we went,
every moment expecting the hail of shrapnel to
begin. Finally the suspense became unbearable
and the sergeant quite lost his temper. “Why to &mdash;&mdash; don’t
those &mdash;&mdash; Russians begin shooting at
us?” he screamed. “They ought to have begun
long ago.” The ungrateful man soon knew, for in
a few minutes we came upon the Russian trenches
quite deserted. They were beautifully dug, and
would have cost us half our strength to storm;
and yet, in order to keep the line intact, the
Russians had preferred to retreat.</p>

<p>Naturally such experiences had left their mark
on the older men. The continual refrain of their
talk was, “We should not mind if we knew that
in the next action we were going to stop a bullet.
It is the uncertainty that is so awful.” At home
our corporal had told us that if we were wounded,
we should be ready to jump a yard in the
air with joy. And to get a “heimatschuss”&mdash;a
wound serious enough to send you home&mdash;was the
great desire of most soldiers. After the first
action we had been in, we all crowded round the
wounded, cheering and congratulating them on
their good luck. I do not wish to be misunderstood.
None of our men were slackers or
malingerers at the front&mdash;except our only Jew.<span id="Page_91" class="pagenum">[91]</span>
When a dangerous job was to be done, there were
always plenty of volunteers. But the men hated
their work, and they had an especial contempt for
the man who could fall so low as to be a soldier
by profession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE FOREST</div>

<p>There were, of course, <a id="Ref_91">oases</a> in this life,
moments of exquisite beauty, and other times
when laughter ruled. There was the spectacle of
Russian villages burning by night&mdash;enormous
masses of smokeless flame leaping to the sky,
vivid colour in its intensest and purest form.
(Lest any one should think that I was a Nero to
gloat over such sights, let me repeat that nothing
of value was destroyed in these villages.) Then
there were the days and nights we spent in the
forest. In those thickets our eyes did not help
us much; all we could do was to listen. Our ears
grew so subtle that we could distinguish and interpret
all the sounds of the forest, and we lived
so close to nature that we seemed to become a
part of it. So quiet were we that the wild deer
used to trip along our line without taking any
notice of us. Other German soldiers were not so
fortunate in their encounters with the wild beasts
of the forests. I have known men so upset by
the stillness of the woods that the mere rustling
of animals in the undergrowth has made them
throw down their arms and take to their heels.
A Prussian major was once leading his battalion
to the attack, when a wild boar rushed out from<span id="Page_92" class="pagenum">[92]</span>
his hiding-place and, scuttling between the major’s
legs, floored him! The major is said to have
cried out, “The enemy is upon us!” and run for
his life. But I do not believe that so easily of a
Prussian major.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SURPRISE ATTACK</div>

<p>Our chief care was to get enough sleep. We
marched by night, in order, I suppose, that the
enemies’ spies should not know where we went.
The Russians were kept well informed of our
movements. This was not wonderful when we
consider that wherever we marched we met refugees
returning to their homes. We even advanced
to battle once through a crowd of these people.
Among them there must certainly have been a
large number of spies. But by marching at night,
when all Russians had to be indoors, we were able
suddenly to reinforce threatened positions and
give the enemy some disagreeable surprises. The
first thing we did after digging ourselves in, was
to go to sleep. One of my earliest lessons in the
art of war was when I was posted as sentry&mdash;in
my simplicity I thought against the Russians&mdash;while
the rest went to sleep. Suddenly the
company sergeant-major appeared in our midst
and wanted to know why the others were all
snoring. Afterwards my corporal took me aside
and explained to me that the company sergeant-major
was a far more dangerous man than
the Russians, and that I had been posted to
prevent surprise from him. That afternoon, however,<span id="Page_93" class="pagenum">[93]</span>
I was able to retrieve my reputation. We
advanced a little, dug ourselves in again, and all
went off to sleep leaving me as sentry, and I was
just able to wake them in time to receive the
lieutenant commanding the company. At last,
one night the Russians made a surprise attack
and caught us in our sleep. There are all sorts
of questions connected with this surprise I should
like answered. Theoretically our arrangements
made such things impossible. We had patrols
all night long in No Man’s Land, we had outposts
half a mile from billets, and we had patrols whose
only business was to go from sentry to sentry and
collect news. Finally, there was a sentry posted
at the billets who ought to have given the alarm
if he heard firing going on. The old regiment
which marched out in August, 1914, would not
have allowed itself to be caught napping so badly.
It could only have happened to a regiment of
recruits. By the last thing I saw of the sergeant-major,
it seemed he had lost his head for once.
Instead of organizing the defence, he was screaming
with fury at the sentry for letting the Russians
in upon us, all the while busily kicking him fore
and aft.</p>

<p>For myself, I plunged in the direction of the
firing, when suddenly the earth to my left seemed
to become alive with flame. To my excited
senses it appeared that a whole regiment was firing
at point-blank range at me alone. We were in a<span id="Page_94" class="pagenum">[94]</span>
country of low sand-dunes; I tried to run, but the
sand hindered my steps, and the volleys of fire
still pursued me. Russian rifles fire much too
high, so the bullets went over my head, but I had
no time to think of that. I plumped down and
shammed dead. The firing stopped at once.
Then I made a sudden start, got a little way, and
then managed to get over the crest of the dune
into the valley below. In a minute or two the
same thing had to be repeated all over again. The
Russians seemed to be everywhere. I can well
believe the huntsmen who say the fox enjoys being
hunted. I really did enjoy this crowded hour of
glorious life. All my faculties were stretched with
the one endeavour to escape. Of consequences
to myself I did not think. That part of me that
could think was simply the spectator at a particularly
thrilling drama. At last I met a corporal
who gave me instructions to proceed in a certain
direction. I went as he instructed me, and I saw
in the distance dim shadowy figures moving. I
hailed them, they stopped, I approached, and
found myself before a party of Russian soldiers.
They grinned and made me welcome. A few
minutes later a burst of loud cheering announced
that the Russians had taken our position by
storm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN CAPTIVITY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>I think it of the greatest importance to set down
exactly how the Russians treated their prisoners,
because the German reports tell of abominable
cruelties, and the Russian denials are often taken
as a matter of course and are not believed. It
is useless to ignore the fact that the prisoners of
war suffered much, and indeed we had to undergo
horrors which even now it appals me to remember.
But of deliberate or methodical cruelty we encountered
little, and when we did come across it,
we usually put it down to the character of the
persons in command, and not to any system enjoined
upon them from above. The few exceptions
will be carefully noted in their proper places.
The Russian is a careless, happy-go-lucky fellow.
A temperament like his makes a man a kind
warder, but at the same time his lack of organizing
power inflicts hardships which a little foresight
could easily prevent. In Russia they told
us that we should be ordered two pounds of meat
a day in Siberia, and should only receive half a
pound. The other pound and a half disappeared
through “squeeze” or “graft.” That fact alone
characterizes the Russian treatment of prisoners<span id="Page_96" class="pagenum">[96]</span>
better than any words of mine can&mdash;its good
intentions spoiled by official incapacity.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that the Russian soldiers
grinned when I suddenly ran into their midst
that night. This gave me my first insight into
their nature. According to what we had been
told in the regiment, the Russian was a bloodthirsty
savage who would cut the throat of any
one who fell into his hands, and who never
showed mercy. I have collected the experiences
of prisoners from every one of the various fronts,
and I have found no instance of cruelty on the
part of the common soldier. The general opinion
of the Russian is reflected in the judgment of an
Austrian officer I knew. “The Russian soldier
is the kindest and warmest-hearted man in the
world, so long as he is not drunk, but then he is
below the beast.” I know some will say, “But
how about the excesses of the Revolution, then?”
To begin with, these excesses are not organized
by Russians, but by Jews, and they are carried
out by Letts and soldiers of the Central Powers
in Russian uniform. And since the Bolsheviks
came into power alcohol has been easy to obtain,
and a drunken soldier has become as common a
sight as it was rare in the last years of the Czar.</p>

<p>There were ugly stories about the Cossacks.
These were seldom related to me by eye-witnesses,
but only repeated at third or fourth hand. One
of the stories is not without its humorous side.<span id="Page_97" class="pagenum">[97]</span>
A little Austrian Jew, the only decent one I met
in captivity, was wounded and left on the field of
battle. The Russians bound up his wounds, but
as the struggle raged to and fro they could not
remove him, and he lay there for days. From
time to time Cossacks would ride by and prod
him with their lances, and shout the question,
“Germanski?” He answered, “No; Austrian.”
If he had said he was a German they would have
killed him on the spot; but if they had known
that he was a Jew they would have hacked him
into a thousand pieces. In any case the cruelty
of the Germans towards the Cossacks justified,
if such things can be justified, the treatment that
the Cossacks occasionally meted out to the
Germans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITH THE RUSSIANS</div>

<p>Providence having led me to these fellows,
I was not inclined to quarrel with its decrees. I
had done all that was required of me, and I did
not conceive it my duty to engage in single combat
with half a dozen Russian soldiers on behalf of
a cause I detested. From the first the soldiers
were decently behaved, almost respectful, and
they left me in possession of all my property. I
was even allowed to keep my knife; but presently
a man came along, who, from the expert way he
searched me, must have been either a policeman
or a thief by profession, and he took everything
of value he could find. Fortunately my breastpurse,
containing £3, escaped his notice. There<span id="Page_98" class="pagenum">[98]</span>
was an amusing moment when one of my captors
drank off the contents of my water-bottle, hoping
to find in it tea or something stronger. When it
proved to be coffee he spat it out in great disgust,
and turned on me, shouting “Germanski!
Lutheranski!” The inference was obvious, that
only a pig of a Lutheran would drink such a mess
as coffee. I dared not laugh out, but in my
heart I thanked him for the incident. The
Russian soldiers were interested in our religion.
They used the word “Lutheranski” as a term of
contempt, while they treated the Catholics with a
certain respect.</p>

<p>Finally, after an anxious quarter of an hour,
spent in dodging German bullets on the one
hand, and, on the other, Russian officers who
wanted my captors to return to the fight, I was
introduced to the General. And at once I was
able to remark the awe which the German name
had inspired. He drew himself up and received
my salute with a ridiculously vain air. Two days
later, at Divisional Headquarters the same feeling
was noticeable. Here, too, the General was
flattered at being saluted by a German soldier.
It nurtured the pride of race in the Germans, and
gave them an immense feeling of superiority even
in captivity.</p>

<p>For some time I was kept here on the edge
of a forest, and had leisure to observe a General
directing a battle. Messengers came hot-foot<span id="Page_99" class="pagenum">[99]</span>
from all directions, and were dismissed as quickly
as they came; at times the General would bellow
his orders into the telephone, and his deep voice
would boom through the forest. It was all so
curious, because of the actual fighting we saw
and heard nothing. It was like blindfold chess.
Most interesting of all was a device for transporting
the wounded&mdash;a litter was bound to two
horses ridden by Cossacks, and slung so as to
hang from the head of the fore horse and the
hindquarters of the rear one. It was very low,
and nothing could have been smoother or freer
from jolting. Our wounded men were put into
springless carts, and they suffered unspeakable
agonies from being bumped about on the rutty,
uneven roads. Here, at any rate, we could have
learned something from the Russians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COSSACKS</div>

<p>The next day the prisoners were gathered
together, and we fell into the hands of the
Cossacks. They began by making gestures as
if they intended to cut our throats, and by pointing
to the trees as if they were going to hang us.
One of us burst into tears; but a Jew who could
speak German explained that they were only
having a joke with us. They were so bitter at
the “dirty lies” the Germans spread about their
cruelty that they thought a little fun of this sort
allowable. A Russian, they added, never hits a
man when he is down. Some hours afterwards
they asked the man why he had cried, and he<span id="Page_100" class="pagenum">[100]</span>
showed himself no fool. He said it was because
he was so hungry. The Cossacks immediately
busied themselves about us, brought us water to
wash with, made us tea, gave us so much supper
that we could not have eaten any more, rolled us
cigarettes, and&mdash;greatest compliment of all&mdash;sometimes
took the half-smoked cigarette out of their
own mouths and put it into ours. Late at night we
set off again, and the Cossacks, as they sat their
horses, with their black caps and their long black
mantles flowing in the moonlight, made a figure
of romance that seemed to carry us out of Europe
into Asia. It took me straight back to the
Middle Ages, and I thought I saw the soldiers
of Saladin or Genghis Khan again. In their
wild, careless ways they were unlike any troops
I had ever known. As horsemen they were far
superior to the German or Austrian cavalry. I
have seen them race their horses at full speed in
and out among the trees of the forest&mdash;a manœuvre
which requires a touch as delicate as it is certain,
because even a slight error would lead to their
brains being dashed out. And I know of no
other cavalry capable of doing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITH THE RUSSIANS</div>

<p>We arrived at Divisional Headquarters the
following day, and were lodged in the loft of a
warehouse. The ground floor was a guard
room, the second floor was a place of detention
for Russian soldiers, and our loft was shared by
spies&mdash;mostly Jews. We were very indignant<span id="Page_101" class="pagenum">[101]</span>
at having them thrust upon us, because we had
done nothing disgraceful. They were soon removed&mdash;out
of consideration for their feelings,
not for ours. The building had been erected
to stock parquet-flooring, and we used to take
out the beautiful examples of Russian peasant-work,
hack them to pieces, and make our fires
with them. The authorities did not trouble about
this destruction of valuable property at all.</p>

<p>We were a mixed lot, Austrians and Germans.
The leader of the Austrians was a Serbian
sergeant, who had been captured on patrol. His
twin brother had been shot beside him, and his
last act in the field had been to bury him and
erect a cross over his head. One day we found
him touched to tears, and asked what the matter
was. It turned out that the Russian General of
the Division could speak Serbian and had actually
been at this man’s home. The Russians were
obviously trying to cajole the Austrian Slavs
round to their side. The other Austrians were
from the Polish Legion. They were said to be
deserters, and they treated the Germans with
haughty contempt. All our communications with
the Russians took place through the Austrians, as
only they could speak a Slav language. They
made use of this to get all they wanted for themselves
and to cheat us in whatever way they could.
It was so throughout the captivity wherever I
went. The Germans had a saying, “We are<span id="Page_102" class="pagenum">[102]</span>
twice in captivity, first to the Russians, secondly
to the Austrians.” The hatred of the Austrians
they had brought with them from the front was
only intensified in captivity, and it will bear bitter
fruit in time to come.</p>

<p>The Germans were mostly peasants from East
Prussia and Silesia. Some of them were very
dirty, and one man did not wash all the while we
were there. Three were suffering from vile skin
diseases. This would have been bad enough, if
we had only been obliged to see it every day.
But our soup was brought to us in a huge bowl,
and we were all supposed to eat out of it with our
spoons. After some days we managed to make
arrangements by which the soup was portioned out
to each one separately. The distribution always
led to fierce quarrels, the Germans accusing the
Austrians of taking too much, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUNGER</div>

<p>The Russians were alive to our differences
and did their best to aggravate them. We were
very badly fed, and once for five days had nothing
to eat but mouldy breadcrumbs, which in other
times I should have been ashamed to throw to
the mice. We began to supplement our diet by
fetching potatoes, but this was forbidden to the
Germans by the lieutenant in charge of us. He
had dark mild eyes which shone with a peculiar
radiance at times, when a smile lit up his face, and
you were inclined to think him the kindest of men.
But that smile only came when he had thought<span id="Page_103" class="pagenum">[103]</span>
out some torture for the “Germanski.” The pangs
of hunger grew so fierce that I could do nothing
but try to sleep all day. Then the lieutenant
would suddenly appear and order us out to do
menial work&mdash;sweep the house or the garden-paths
or clear up horse-dung with our hands.
This last we refused to do, and our guards, kinder
than their superiors, never insisted. The first
time I went out, I was so giddy that I could
scarcely stand. The Austrians, who were well
fed and had nothing to do, rather enjoyed the
spectacle of our humiliation.</p>

<p>The kindness of the Russian soldiers helped
us through. I had made especial friends with a
certain set by paying them extravagant prices for
a mug, a towel, and a cake of soap. They always
gave me something when they saw me&mdash;bread, or
meat, or soup, or sugar. One man offered me a
cigarette once, but I pointed to my heart and
refused. He was not to be baulked of his kindness,
however. He searched his pockets and
took out a handful of sugar and gave it me, saying,
“Well, then, Daddy” (I was so called on account
of my big beard) “take that.” Sugar was a very
important article of diet, because it served to make
the moist Russian bread palatable.</p>

<p>Fairness compels me to say that the Germans
probably brought their misfortunes on themselves.
In conversation one of them had used the phrase,
“Schweinspolak,” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> a pig of Pole, a somewhat<span id="Page_104" class="pagenum">[104]</span>
frequent term of abuse in Germany. Our guards
were Poles, and when they called his attention to
what he had said, he did not even attempt an
apology, but only tried to laugh it off. Under the
circumstances the action of the Russians is easy
to understand, if not to forgive.</p>

<p>We had plenty of excitement. One day a
German aeroplane appeared overhead and proceeded
to bomb us. The Russians were very
angry, and they called it “ignoble warfare” to
throw bombs at headquarters. For a time it
looked as if they would take their revenge on us,
but fortunately no damage was done, and they
forgave us. Then we could hear the thunder of
the guns coming nearer every day, and there was
a prospect of our being released by our own men.
One day the cannonading was more violent than
ever, and the Russians told us the Germans were
making an attack in force. After that the echoes
of the fight grew fainter, and we learned that the
Germans had been beaten off and were now
retreating. Wounded began to pour in, and I
had an opportunity of observing a Russian general
speaking to his men. He addressed them in
kindly tones, with an open, fatherly simplicity, very
different from the rasping accents and calculated
harshness which our generals thought good enough
for us. The men listened, too, like children,
staring at him vacantly with big, open eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUSSIAN PEASANTS</div>

<p>Then one day a large batch of Austrian<span id="Page_105" class="pagenum">[105]</span>
prisoners arrived and we were sent on by foot.
For three weeks we marched, beginning somewhere
near Minsk and ending, I think, at
Smolensk. We had no maps and had only a
vague idea of where we were. Every day we
walked the distance between one command and
another, receiving new guards at each command.
As in Russia the guard is not set until twelve
o’clock, it meant that we never started out before
midday, whether the distance to be traversed
was ten miles or forty. At first we slept in barns,
but as soon as it grew cold we were put into
peasants’ houses, schools, or synagogues. The
peasants received us with their native kindness
and often gave us food over and above our rations.
We were generally ungrateful guests. One old
lady boiled a pailful of potatoes for us at supper
and at breakfast, and in other little ways did all
she could to make us feel comfortable. The men
rewarded her by stealing all her spoons, knives,
and forks that they could put their hands on.
When remonstrated with, they replied that they
were in a hostile country, and that they recognized
no obligations towards the enemy. This principle,
which is a matter of course in the German Army,
explains those stories published in the <cite>Cornhill</cite>
for September about the behaviour of captured
German sailors. The enemy remains the enemy;
you are allowed to take any advantage of him you
can, and no chivalry or friendliness on his part<span id="Page_106" class="pagenum">[106]</span>
can change this fundamental fact of the situation.
The German magazines were full of stories in
which a German by betraying a woman or some
other act of base treachery gains an advantage for
his country. The very characteristic, which in
English stories is attributed to the German in
hatred and disgust, they imagine to be admirable
and acknowledge with pride. An account was
published of how some survivors of the <em>Emden</em>
were making their way across the desert&mdash;I
believe in the neighbourhood of the Red Sea.
They kept up a running fight with Arabs and
were at last entirely surrounded. Seeing no way
out, their commander desired an interview with
the Arab chief, pledging his word that his life
should be saved. The Arab refused to come, as
he feared that he would be shot in spite of the
pledge. The German narrator added, “And in
that he was quite right. I should have shot him.”
The story struck me at the time as being more or
less mythical, but, if invented, it is characteristic
that just such an incident should be chosen and
related with approval.</p>

<p>The Russian peasant at that time was living
well. He often had meat for supper as well as
for breakfast. To each cottage there was attached
a number of outhouses, with room for a horse, a
cow, a pig, and so on. We were surprised at
how many animals there were in every village,
and it was evident that Russia was far from being<span id="Page_107" class="pagenum">[107]</span>
starved out. The peasant’s house consisted of
one room. A broad seat ran along its walls, on
this at night mattresses were spread out for the
older members of the family to sleep on. In a
corner of the room there was the stove&mdash;an
enormous brick erection&mdash;and high up in its niches
and alcoves the younger members of the family
slept, while on the topmost perch the poultry
found room. We spent the night on the floor,
packed in hay or straw. The rising of the family
in the morning always interested me. First the
cock would flap his wings and crow, then one by
one the girls and boys would come tumbling off
the stove, and then the father and mother, gaffers
and gammers, aunts and uncles would stretch
themselves, and begin to get up. (They had no
night attire and no bedding except the mattress
and a pillow.) They then went out to wash.
They took a small jug of water, filled their mouths
with it, and then squirted the resulting liquid on
to their hands and applied it to their faces. We
never had any trouble with them, except once
when we sat down to a meal without taking our
caps off. They pointed to the ikon which hung
in a corner of the room, and gave us to understand
that they had been shocked by our irreverent
conduct. I do not mention these details with any
idea of laughing at our hosts. But I think it
worth while to set down how the Russian peasant
lived before the Revolution.</p>

<p><span id="Page_108" class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>Our labourers were filled with amazement
at the primitive workmanship of the Russians.
The peasant is a jack-of-all-trades&mdash;agriculturist,
carpenter, mason, wheelwright, weaver, and so
on. The consequence is that nothing gets done
well. The plough is as simple as Abraham’s
must have been. Our carpenters declared that
in Germany an apprentice of fourteen could make
better gates, doors, window-frames, and wheels
than those they saw in Russia. The peasants
often wore shoes of bast, even in the dirtiest
weather, and in their general appearance they
reminded me of pictures of Anglo-Saxon serfs
I had seen somewhere. Sometimes the remarks
of our men went too far. Russian pigs are sometimes
bred from an English strain and show the
tawny tiger-like markings of certain English
breeds. This kind of pig was unfamiliar to my
companions, and when they caught sight of it for
the first time, they said, “Look there, they can’t
even tame pigs, they have only wild swine running
about!” The more they saw of the Russian
peasant, the more amazed our men were that
Russia had been able to do so much in the war.
They thought it almost impossible to build up an
army with material of this quality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SYNAGOGUES</div>

<p>We most enjoyed being in the synagogues.
The Jews would come early in the morning to
hold a service. They would put on the sacred
robes and adorn themselves with phylacteries and<span id="Page_109" class="pagenum">[109]</span>
then begin to chant the holy words. Suddenly,
quick as lightning, they would spit over their
shoulders adroitly as a London cabman, or they
would empty their noses between finger and
thumb on to the floor, and then resume the
solemn rise and fall of their chant as if nothing
had happened. The very moment they had
finished and disrobed, they began bargaining
with one another with the same zeal that they
had just shown in prayer. We were never tired
of listening to the harsh, discordant jangle of their
voices, not united, but, as it seemed, vying with
one another in prayer. And I was never tired of
hearing the explanation our Catholic workmen
had to offer of all this jarring noise. Their priests
had assured them that it was a punishment on
the Jews, that ever since the time they had
quarrelled over the fate of Christ they were
doomed, when they assembled in the synagogue,
to wrangle helplessly with one another and not
to pray. We were quartered in synagogues as a
deliberate insult to the Jews. Often the soldiers
would break in on their services and send them
away. They have not forgotten these things,
and now that they are the masters of Russia,
they are showing how consummately they understand
the art of revenge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUSSIAN ARMY</div>

<p>Our journey took us across the Great Plain,
through forests of birch and fir, or by desolate
marshes, the infrequent villages forming our<span id="Page_110" class="pagenum">[110]</span>
halting-places for the day. This may sound
monotonous, but scenery diversified by birch
trees is never uninteresting, as the grey of their
bark responds so readily to every change of light
and colour in the atmosphere. I shall never forget
one October morning, when I saw a rose-red
sunrise over a forest of birch trees hung with the
startling white of hoar-frost, the most beautiful
sunrise, I think, that I have ever seen. Sometimes,
too, on approaching the great towns we
felt the charm and mystery of “Holy Russia” of
story, when we saw the gilded crosses and domes
of the cathedrals flashing splendidly in the sun
and heard the deep melodious tolling of the bells.
During the whole of our march we came upon
women and soldiers digging trenches and throwing
up new positions for the Russians to fall back
upon in case of need. Even a hundred miles or
more behind the front this work was still going
on. My companions, who pretended to despise
the Russians so much and to be so patriotic,
disgusted me every time they saw these trenches.
“Perhaps,” they said, “the Russians will ask us
to dig trenches for them and pay us.” They
were eager to help the Russians fight their own
army, if only they got some money for it. And
when they heard we were going to Siberia, most
of them were ready to volunteer for work in
munition factories. The Russians, however,
allowed them no choice. The Germans showed<span id="Page_111" class="pagenum">[111]</span>
up still worse, when the Russian officers tried to
get information out of them. God knows, I
grudged the Russians nothing, but loyalty to the
uniform I wore compelled me to withhold all I
could. They would begin with me and ask me
the strength of our company. Putting on as
innocent an air as possible, I would answer that
in Germany a company was reckoned at anything
from two hundred to two hundred and fifty men.
Whereupon my comrades would begin to snigger,
and in a few minutes would be giving information
that our company was not one hundred and
twenty strong, that of these half were raw
recruits, of these, again, half were “Ersatz-reserve,”
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> mostly men who had in times of
peace been declared unfit for service because
of some bodily weakness. Curious differences
between Russian and German methods used to
come out as a result of these interrogatories.
The Russians would ask where we had been at
the front, or where we were captured, and we
would reply that we did not know. At first they
would get angry and declare it was cowardly to
say we didn’t know; if we didn’t want to tell, we
had simply to say so. They added, a soldier
never lies. But it was really true, we were
always kept in the dark as to where we happened
to be, and we did not know the names of the men
commanding our division, corps, or army. Then
the Russians would say that when they were in<span id="Page_112" class="pagenum">[112]</span>
East Prussia, they used to tell their soldiers
everything; it was their plan to make confidants
of their men. And then, as if to show they had
only been testing us, they gave us all the information
they had just been asking for, showed us the
march-route of the regiment and exactly where it
was at the time, adding all sorts of intimate details
of which we had no idea ourselves. They knew
all about the arrival of reinforcements within an
hour or two of their coming to the front. Then
we would be dismissed, the tale-bearers among
us feeling rather bitter at having been played
with and at not receiving the extra rations or the
freedom from menial labour they had hoped for.</p>

<p>We got other glimpses of life in the Russian
Army. Sometimes we would recognize deserters,
Poles who had gone over to the Russians and
donned their uniform. Once we saw one of our
own spies. From time to time we would see
regiments marching to the front, the first battalion
armed with rifles, the others without weapons,
nor would they get any till the first battalion was
all dead or wounded. Or light munition columns
would pass us by, none of the convoy armed
except the leader. Then we began to understand
some of the difficulties of the Russian position
and how cheap our victories had been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RED CROSS</div>

<p>Wherever we halted at a village, the peasants
flocked around us, as inquisitive and naïve as
children. The women were always gay in scarlet<span id="Page_113" class="pagenum">[113]</span>
or yellow or peacock blue, or sometimes all together,
and every one talking twenty to the dozen.
My beard made me conspicuous, and I was asked
three questions, my age, was I married, and how
many children I had. I learned the answers off
by heart (I knew no Russian at that time), but
occasionally the questions came in the wrong order.
So I found myself telling them that I had thirty-five
children, was four years old, and had been
married a year. Then they would all roar with
laughter and shake their heads at me and think
me a sad dog. When they found that I was a
father, they opened their hearts to me immediately
and adopted me as one of themselves, brought
their children to me and made me say which my
boy resembled most, this one or that one. The
Russian peasant lives very near to nature. From
time to time we came to Red Cross stations and
were fed right royally. Permission to entertain
us was always given to the Red Cross workers as
a matter of course. Now, here is a point which
let those explain who understand the hearts of
men and of women. I with my beard looked far
and away the oldest of the party. When we were
lined up and a soldier distributed the gifts, he
generally began with me and I came off best.
But when a sister had charge of things, I was
always badly treated. Sometimes the sister
would quite pass me over, and that with a sniff
which would have been annihilating if it had not<span id="Page_114" class="pagenum">[114]</span>
amused me so much. But in any case there is
one point I should like to insist upon. In the
course of a three weeks’ march through Russian
towns and villages, no one ever insulted us, or
spat in our coffee, or poured water on the ground
before us when we were thirsty. We were
treated with open-hearted kindness and good will
even by people who in private conversation
proved to be politically red-hot Chauvinists.
The German prisoners used to put this friendliness
down to stupidity and to fear of the German
arms, and they despised the Russians all the more
for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSPORTS</div>

<p>Towards the end of our march we left the
narrow lanes and came upon one of the great
central roads of Russia, broader and better paved
than any in Germany, with a strip of soft sand at the
side for horsemen, and carried over the marshes
on a high and solid dam like the Roman roads
of old. This great road was as full of life as
Piccadilly. Our men were furious at the large
number of American motor-vans bound with war
material for the front, both because they were
American and because they were better than anything
the Germans had. And then occurred one
of those incidents which used to give the Germans
such an immense feeling of superiority to the
Russians. A large transport of horses had to be
conveyed from one command to another. There
were only a few soldiers and some hundreds of<span id="Page_115" class="pagenum">[115]</span>
horses, and various devices had been adopted to
prevent the horses from running away. Some
were bound together in companies of ten, the
head of one horse being fastened to the tail of
another. Or they were harnessed to wagons,
three or four in front, two behind, and the rest at
the sides. We were put in the wagons or even
allowed to ride on horseback. On either side of
our road was boundless steppe or open forest.
Every time a motor-van came along, the nerves
of the horses were upset, and they plunged wildly
in all directions. Those that were free went
careering over the steppe. Those that were
bound head to tail insisted on tying themselves
in a knot round the telegraph posts, taking a sort
of mulish pleasure in the more entangling themselves
the more we tried to untie them, so that it
sometimes lasted three-quarters of an hour before
we could get them free. The horses attached to
the wagons all started off in different directions,
and if they ever did agree, it was in the direction
of the steppe. We got turned out into the ditch
so often that we decided to continue the journey
independently on foot, while the Russians, considering
the horses more important than the
prisoners, let us do as we liked. In four hours
they brought those horses three miles. When it
got dark, confusion became worse confounded, as
the enormous headlights of the motors only made
the horses shy all the more. How many were<span id="Page_116" class="pagenum">[116]</span>
lost, no one ever knew. We tramped on till the
small hours of the morning, and found the night
as interesting as the day. The forest was full of
camp-fires where the Jewish pedlars had stopped
to rest. They turn their wagons in among the
trees, build a light lean-to of boughs as a shelter
against the wind, and in front of the lean-to they
make a big fire. Then they all lie down between
lean-to and fire and cosily go off to sleep. I
came upon a family of ten sleeping in this way,
women and girls in the middle, men on the wings.
The feet of the women were bare and stretched
out towards the fire, and everybody seemed fast
asleep, but I had not been there a fraction of a
minute before the feet were withdrawn so quickly
that you could not see how it was done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOSCOW</div>

<p>At last the first winter snow drifted down and
marching became impossible, so we were put in
the train for Moscow. I had long wished to visit
Moscow, but I saw nothing of it except Singer’s
Sewing-machine factory. This was a really fine
building, as up to date as anything in Germany.
Every peasant’s hut we had visited had been
adorned by Singer’s calendars. They always set
my teeth on edge a little, because their startling
modernity was so out of place in the medieval
filth and backwardness of the Russian village.
At Moscow we were sorted out into our various
nationalities. Germans, Jews, and Hungarians
were to be punished by being sent to Siberia.<span id="Page_117" class="pagenum">[117]</span>
All the oppressed races from Schleswig-Holstein
to Alsace-Lorraine, all Slavs, Rumanians, and
Italians were to be kept in Russia. As a matter
of fact, those who went to Siberia had the best of
it in the end, because food was cheap and plentiful,
while those who stayed in Russia were half
starved. Other Germans were punished by being
sent north to build the Murman line. One of the
few men who survived told me that the men
perished like flies. The country was a stretch of
horrible marshland, and the moisture seemed to
get into the men’s constitutions and rot their
bodies. The food was insufficient and of the
wrong kind, and as a consequence scurvy spread
through their ranks like a forest fire. The
Murman line got itself built at last, but, it was
said, at the cost of thousands of lives. Other
Germans were kept at the front to repair bridges
and throw up trenches&mdash;often under the fire of
their own artillery. At Moscow a neutral consul
presented each of us with three roubles and a
copy of St. John’s Gospel. It had been printed
in German at Cambridge and was published by
the British and Foreign Bible Society. The
German soldiers were surprised that a British
society should thus interest itself in the spiritual
wants of the enemy. They were grateful, as the
leaves of the booklet were just the right size and
thinness for cigarette-paper. The Catholics were
doubtful about the book, suspecting a Protestant<span id="Page_118" class="pagenum">[118]</span>
trap or some contrivance to proselytize them.
On others of us the reading of St. John made an
impression that would have been impossible in
ordinary times. The very poverty of our circumstances
allowed us to concentrate our minds upon
it as we could never have done before. The
impression made was not altogether a religious
one, nor one probably that the Bible Society
aimed at. But its poetry and fire worked upon
us in such a way that, although I may forget
everything else that came to me that year, I shall
not forget the hours spent in reading St. John.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TO SIBERIA</div>

<p>It was early November when we started for
Siberia. Snow had already fallen, and the rivers
were frozen over. Life in the country seemed to
have died out, and the monotony of the eternal
snow became intolerable. I began to suffer from
snow-blindness, and at night to see visions which
afforded me a strange mixture of almost intolerable
pain and exquisite pleasure at the same
time. Brilliant forms&mdash;purple, orange, scarlet,
blue&mdash;danced before my eyes, and I thought I
had never seen anything so beautiful, while at the
same time my head was throbbing with pain as
in fever. Siberia was at first an agreeable disappointment
to us. We had always thought of it
as a wild and barbarous place, and we were surprised
to find it in many ways more modern than
Russia. Baikal afforded us the pleasantest surprise.
Most of us had never heard of it before.<span id="Page_119" class="pagenum">[119]</span>
We saw it under superb conditions. Never, even
in Switzerland, have I seen a lake with a blue so
gay or snow-capped hills shining so splendidly in
the sun. Often we met train-loads of Russian
soldiers on their way to the front, and they treated
us as comrades. Some, indeed, asked us what
sort of life prisoners of war led in Germany, and
if we could give them letters of recommendation for
any German who might happen to capture them.</p>

<p>We were fed on the same rations as the
Russian soldiers themselves, receiving at least half
a litre of good soup daily, with the meat that had
been boiled in it. The meat was cut up on the
dirty boards of the carriage, and then passed from
unwashed hand to unwashed hand until it reached
the man for whom it was intended. Twenty pairs
of verminous, soot-black hands might have touched
your meat before it got to you. In addition we
had two (Russian) pounds of black bread per day.
This was sour and so moist that you could sometimes
wring the water out of it. The crown of our
feast was the “Kasha,” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, buckwheat or other
porridge drenched in fat. At first we liked this
better even than the delicious Russian soups, but
afterwards in camp we grew so tired of it that we
used to feed the pigs with it. If we had always
received our rations they would have been ample.
But on the railway our guards were changed every
three or four days, and this system gave them a
good opportunity of cheating us. We would<span id="Page_120" class="pagenum">[120]</span>
receive guards, say for Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday. On Monday and Tuesday we would
get our food; but on Wednesday the guards would
disappear without troubling about it, and the new
ones did not give us anything till Thursday. The
food for each man cost twenty-five kopecks a day,
and as there were never less than six hundred and
often over a thousand men in the transport, our
little guard of ten soldiers made a handsome profit.
The only Russians to treat us with perfect honesty
were the Cossacks. Those of us who had money
could buy as much as they liked at the stations.
Food was good and cheap in those days. A pound
of roast mutton cost fifteen kopecks, a roast fowl
forty to fifty kopecks, a roast duck a rouble, besides
there was white, grey, and black bread, every sort
of roll and biscuit, cheese, ham, bacon, butter, milk,
and many sorts of excellent fish. Each station
was a new adventure, where you explored strange
and unknown sorts of food. Sugar became rarer
the further east we went, and at some stations
could only be supplied to soldiers; but we always
had a supply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN SOCIALISTS</div>

<p>We were a very mixed company, thirty, sometimes
forty, men in a luggage van. We were
mostly working-men, and the relations between
them and the educated classes were very bad.
They bore a grudge against us for being what we
were, and tried by all sorts of pinpricks to make
life a burden to us. The working-man dearly likes<span id="Page_121" class="pagenum">[121]</span>
overheated rooms, possibly because it is a luxury
he cannot afford at home. They would go on
piling coal on the fire till the truck was like a
furnace; in the pitiless, unbearable heat our brains
would seem to be bursting, and we would throw
off nearly all our clothes. When they had got us
so far, the working-men would suddenly open the
windows and let in on us the icy Siberian winter air
with its temperature of twenty or thirty degrees
below zero. We knew exactly what to expect from
them if ever they should get the upper hand in the
State. The Socialists ruled among them unquestioned.
They would hold forth by the hour and no
one of their class said a word against them. The
chief use of the German Army seemed to be as an
institution for the diffusion of Socialism throughout
the whole nation. Our labourers were mostly
inclined to be rough bullies, but they were cowards,
and let anybody alone who showed fight. None
of them were above cringing, fawning, or begging.
It used to disgust me to see men wearing the
uniform of a great army begging for pitiful odds
and ends that they did not really need. Their
philosophy was simple. If they wanted a thing,
they must have it; if they could not beg or wheedle
it out of its owner, they must steal it.</p>

<p>They were all expert thieves. Even in Germany
the working-man has no particular scruples
about stealing. A friend of mine once had his
house decorated, and the workmen left their ladder<span id="Page_122" class="pagenum">[122]</span>
behind. His groom noticed it and went to his
master, full of joy, suggesting that he should paint
the ladder green, so that the workmen should not
recognize it when they came back to look for it.
And he was astonished when my friend could
not see how reasonable his proposal was. Our
prisoners stole whatever they wanted or could lay
their hands on. We “conveyed” coal to our
wagon at every station. At another station we
carried off a stove from some building because
ours didn’t suit us. Peasant women used to come
to the train, selling rolls of bread. One man would
occupy her attention by bargaining with her
keenly, while from behind others would fill their
tunics with rolls and make off. Once when I had
just paid an old woman a rouble, and was waiting
for my change, she caught a man in the act of
stealing. He at once races off; she sticks my
rouble between her teeth, gathers up her skirts,
and pursues, I behind her, anxious for my rouble.
Everybody on the station stood and shook with
laughter. As the train moved out, I succeeded
in getting my change, but found the old lady as
big a rogue as any of them, she had cheated me
out of half of it.</p>

<p>It was no use telling the soldiers that these
women were peasants like themselves. They
remained quite indifferent. The remonstrances
they made to one another were illuminating.
“It’s all right to steal, but you might leave a little<span id="Page_123" class="pagenum">[123]</span>
for your comrades.” “I don’t mind stealing so
much; but you might share with us.” “It’s
selfish of you to attract attention by stealing like
that; we can’t steal now.” And the soldiers
who spoke thus are now the masters of Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUSSIAN MAGNANIMITY</div>

<p>But there was one incident which shocked
even them. On the way to Moscow our guards
travelled in the truck with us. One Sunday they
had been absent all day, and two comrades of
theirs had taken their place. When they came
back, they found that all their white bread had
been stolen out of their knapsacks. With fine
German tact we immediately suggested that their
comrades had done it; but they quietly answered
that no Russian soldier ever stole from a comrade.
Upon this we offered to show them our
knapsacks and prove our innocence, but with a
certain dignity they put the matter aside. However,
it mattered to us, so a general search of all
knapsacks and baggage was ordered, without
anything being found. One man was then observed
to be getting rid of some white breadcrumbs,
and on closer inspection we found remains
of white bread by him. Upon this a Hungarian
related that he had seen the theft, but, as he had
no taste for tale-bearing, had held his tongue.
We reported our discoveries to the Russian, who
simply said God would punish the thief. We
sent the culprit to Coventry, and he passed the
time weeping bitter tears; but the Russian was<span id="Page_124" class="pagenum">[124]</span>
pointedly kind to him all the while he was with
us, and when he went away shook hands with
him in front of us all. There was not one of the
Germans who did not feel the moral superiority
of the Russian, and acknowledge that such a fine
temper would have been impossible in a German
guarding prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The thief happened to be a schoolmaster, and
the incident made it impossible for educated men
to exert their influence any longer. We had to
sit and listen for days to jeers at the morality of
the educated classes. The German soldier, unlike
the Russian, makes no fine distinctions about not
stealing from comrades. This same schoolmaster
stole all my sugar once, and as his appetite was
insatiable, he ate it up in a single night. Other
“Kameraden” at various times relieved me of
my towels and soap. Not that they desired a
wash. They stole these things only to sell them
again to educated men in the other trucks.
Captivity mercifully numbs a prisoner’s senses,
and few things hurt. But the misery of continual
association with companions of this kind tells
upon a man as certainly as pain.</p>

<p>Indeed, I do not think it possible to paint the
horror of this journey. Hunger, dirt, and lice&mdash;that
was the burden of our thoughts. I did not
get a bath or an exchange of linen between
September 11 and December 9. And even in
September I had been laughed at as a mad<span id="Page_125" class="pagenum">[125]</span>
Englishman for plunging into the cold river.
Once I paid a rouble for hot water; but when
the soldiers understood that I was going to waste
it on a bath they commandeered it for their tea.
We could keep our hands and faces fairly clean&mdash;if
only by washing in the snow by the side of
the railway. But our working-men never troubled,
and our particular part of the transport was so
dirty that the others called us the “Nigger Minstrels.”
We could not even get them to sweep
the truck out periodically, but they used to let the
dirt accumulate from week to week.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VERMIN</div>

<p>And then the lice. I shall never forget the
first one I discovered on my collar-band. The
horror of that moment never diminished, familiarity
only bred deeper disgust. Every day we
took off all our clothing and searched it; towards
the end it was necessary to do so three or four
times a day. We never found less than a hundred
lice at a search. Verminousness breaks a man’s
spirit more completely than any other affliction;
he loathes himself, and from self-loathing quickly
falls into despondency and despair. Besides, we
all knew that the louse was the carrier of that
dread disease, hemorrhagic typhus, of whose
ravages we had heard so much. Considering that
the whole transport was in the same condition
with regard to lice as ourselves, it is a wonder
that no disease broke out on the journey.</p>

<p>Outwardly we were the merriest crew<span id="Page_126" class="pagenum">[126]</span>
imaginable. We had our professional clowns,
who every night brought out the same hits of last
season’s music-halls. We had our professional
“raconteur,” a Pole, with a real gift both for
story-telling and repartee, and who could make
the dullest party lively. We had our soldiers’
songs, reminiscences of the field and of the
garrison, eternal discussions about Catholic and
Protestant, Socialism and Capitalism, and a thousand
other things to keep us going. And there
was one unceasing subject of interest that rarely
let us think of anything else, namely, when were
we going to get our next meal. It is an uncertainty
that would add piquancy to almost any
situation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRETENSK</div>

<p>At last, somewhere early in December, we
arrived at our journey’s end&mdash;a small Cossack
station the other side of Lake Baikal, called
Stretensk. Our stay began well. The Commandant
asked us if we had any claims to make
on account of money or food that had been withheld,
and he actually allowed all we put in. Then
we were marched across the frozen river to the
camp. So far as we could see, this was a collection
of low wooden and brick buildings stretching
for about a mile on a plateau above the river.
We were taken to a big brick barracks, and there
left for the night. No preparations had been
made to receive us; our new home was thick
with dirt; outside, the temperature was many<span id="Page_127" class="pagenum">[127]</span>
degrees below zero, while inside, the stoves could
not be lighted till the next day. We were a
collection of scarecrows, so pitifully clad that it
would have been a shame to expose us to a German
winter, and we were in the wilds of Siberia;
we were indescribably filthy; our bodies were a
mass of festering sores; and yet the whole night
the barracks was jubilant with song, chorus
answered to chorus, and company vied with company
in seeing who could sing longest and loudest;
and our ragged regiment appeared rather to be
celebrating carnival than its arrival at a prison.
For three months we had not been able to send
a letter, and now we had come to a place from
which at last we could write home.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SIBERIA</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The exalted mood did not last long, and by next
morning we had sobered down. Few of us, I
believe, expected to come out of that barracks
alive. Already, in little more than a year, seventy
thousand prisoners of war were said to have died
of disease in Russia. Comrades of ours, who
came from Novonikolaievsk, told us that in this
camp forty-five per cent. of their numbers, or more
than twelve thousand men, had died of typhus
within a few months. The figures are probably
exaggerated, but there is no doubt that the death-rate
had been appalling. No one will ever know
exactly how many lives were lost, because the
Russian organization broke down under the strain
of providing for so many prisoners, and we do
not even know how many there were to die.
From men who had been through such epidemics
we heard terrible stories of how the sick were
neglected in the hospitals, and of how the illnesses
arose and spread. One medical student who was
taken ill with typhus was put in a so-called
“general hospital.” The building dignified by
such a name consisted of a long, low, narrow
room, in which were packed men, women, and<span id="Page_129" class="pagenum">[129]</span>
children suffering from every kind of disease.
On one side of my friend was a girl in the last
stages of tuberculosis, on the other a woman
expecting her first child. They received no
medical treatment; no doctor ever visited the
patients. My friend set about doing what he
could for the people around him. Then delirium
seized him, and when he recovered he found that
the girl had died, and that the baby had come
into the world and died too. He was used to
hospital life, but the scenes of helpless, untended
misery he saw shook even his nerve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYPHUS</div>

<p>Or again, men from the camp at Barnaul who
had been sent to Stretensk, described to us how
the typhus swept through whole barracks at a
time. Men died where they lay, and it was hours
before anybody came to remove them, meanwhile
the living had to get used to the sight of their
dead comrades. We were told how the disease
started at one end of the barracks, and you
watched it gradually approaching you, man by
man in the line being struck down, and only a
few left here and there. You would wonder how
long it would take to come to you, and see it
creeping nearer day by day. Then one night
you would wake up and find the man on your left
dead of the disease, and some one on your right
in the throes of delirium, and you would conclude
that the disease had passed you by, and that for
the present you were safe. The men from<span id="Page_130" class="pagenum">[130]</span>
Barnaul pointed out that all the conditions favourable
for typhus were present&mdash;hunger, bad air,
and dirt. The disease is often called “hunger-typhus”
in German, and nothing encourages its
development so much as malnutrition. None of
us were well enough fed to satisfy the keen
appetite engendered by the severe Russian winter.
As for the bad air&mdash;ventilation was difficult in
the barracks, because the outside air was so very
cold. When we opened a window, it came pouring
in, condensing at once into a thick, fog-like
vapour, which made everything clammy and
moist. We could never open the window long
enough to let the bad air escape. The atmosphere
of the barracks was heavy with the smell of
unwashed men, of damp, unswept floors, of clothes
hung out to dry, of oily soups, and with the acrid
reek of coarse tobacco. The men hardly ever
went out, but preferred to lie on their benches all
day, doing nothing but smoke. As for the dirt&mdash;we
were supposed to bath regularly, but the
attendant at the bath-house demanded a tip before
he admitted anybody. The result was that some
went every day, while others never had a bath at
all. It was difficult to get in a daily wash. We
were forbidden to wash in the barracks, because
that made the floor dirty, and it was impossible
to go outside in the cold and wash. The problem
was solved by most men not washing at all, while
others got up in the middle of the night, when it<span id="Page_131" class="pagenum">[131]</span>
was quite dark, and had a wash on the sly. For
a week or two I cleaned myself with tea, as I
could get no other water.</p>

<p>There were over eight thousand prisoners at
Stretensk when the disease broke out, and to
combat it there were two Austrian doctors. They
had at their disposal a room capable of holding
fifteen beds, and for medicine a quantity of iodine
and castor oil. I once strolled into the hospital
by mistake. I saw a number of beds on which
men were lolling fully dressed, other patients
were leaning against the wall, others were in
various postures on the floor. It all looked so
casual that I thought it was the waiting-room.
An orderly drove me away, and explained that
the men on the beds were dying of typhus, and
that the other men were waiting their turn to get
a bed and die too.</p>

<p>Our barracks had been built for occupation by
Russian soldiers. It was a long, one-storied
brick erection. Inside it was “double-decked,”
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> there were parallel rows of double platforms,
one above the other. It would comfortably take
about a hundred men, while four hundred of us
were crammed into it. At night I slept with my
neighbour’s knees in my back, and my knees in
the next man’s back. Just so much space as we
could cover lying on our sides was ours, and this
was our sitting-room, drawing-room, dining-room,
and bedroom. As the windows were coated with<span id="Page_132" class="pagenum">[132]</span>
ice inches thick, the barracks remained dark
through the whole winter. The atmosphere, as
I have already mentioned, was always foul. We
were organized into groups of thirteen men, each
of whom elected a corporal as leader; a certain
number of groups again were under a sergeant.
The labourers, of course, always elected one of
their own number as corporal, and the educated
men had a foretaste of the dictatorship of the
proletariat. The labourer’s dream of heaven is
to lie on his bed all day, do nothing, and have
his meals brought to him. They were now able
to enjoy this paradise, with the additional relish
of making the hated bourgeois fetch and carry for
them. If you tried to avoid being made use of
in this manner, and kept away from your place,
they would fetch the dinner and eat your portion
because you were not there. Appeal to the
sergeant was useless, because he too nursed a
grievance against the “upper” classes. The
educated N.C.O.s were just as bad in their way.
I tried an experiment on them by describing
myself in the official lists as a “teacher.” They
thought that meant elementary school teacher,
and treated me with that brutality which the
middle classes show to a man a shade below them
in position. They soon found out their mistake,
and then came fawning to me, abjectly apologetic.
It is the plain truth that there was no feeling of
responsibility or good comradeship among our<span id="Page_133" class="pagenum">[133]</span>
N.C.O.s. They invariably treated us more
roughly than the Russians did.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUR TASKS</div>

<p>We had many different kinds of work to do.
Sometimes we were water-carriers, and had to get
up at four in the morning, go down to the river,
and keep on ladling up water from a hole in the
ice until we had filled a big barrel. This journey
had to be repeated several times a day. Or we
would have to stand for hours chopping wood, or
make long journeys to the wood-stacks to fetch
fuel for the camp. In the intense cold these tasks
would have been severe enough in any case, but
we were ill prepared for them. At the best we
had only summer clothes on, none of us had any
protection for the ears or nose against frostbite,
many had no gloves, while a few had not even
soles to their boots. It was no use reporting
these things, our sergeant used to drive us away in
a fury. The Russians were humaner and would
often send us back with our tasks half done,
because they saw that the cold was too much
for us.</p>

<p>Our life at Stretensk was full of tragedies, but
I think the first is the most awful to remember.
One of us, who had no gloves, had been forced to
carry wood long distances through the cold, and
his hands were badly frostbitten. The sinews
perished and seemed to shrivel up, and he became
unable to use his fingers. As a consequence he
could not louse himself, as his fingers could<span id="Page_134" class="pagenum">[134]</span>
neither grasp anything nor press even a louse to
death. He became so verminous that in places
the insects stood on him ten deep. His “corporalschaft,”
fearing for themselves, expelled him from
their midst. He pilgrimed all over the barracks,
seeking a place where he might lay his head, <a id="Ref_134">but</a> was
everywhere driven off with contumely and insult.
The floor being too wet even for him to sleep on,
he at last found an asylum in a sort of dustbin, in
which the refuse of the barracks was removed
every morning. He lived absolutely alone, like
a leper. His food was set apart for him every
day, and he was jealously watched lest he should
come too near. The self-loathing peculiar to
verminousness seemed to eat up his moral fibre,
and he acquiesced in his isolation as if it were
quite proper. Now and again, indeed, he would
make timid advances, with a pitiful smile, but he
was always repulsed. The last time I saw him,
he was sitting on the snow in the full blaze of the
noonday sun, clad in a smart uniform he had just
received, and feebly trying with his palsied hands
to brush off the lice that had already begun to
collect on his new clothes. That evening he was
taken to hospital with high fever, and in two
days he was dead, literally destroyed by lice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RED CROSS</div>

<p>But one day the barracks was swept and
tidied up as it never had been before, and each of
us was sprinkled with some disinfectant or other.
We were at a loss to interpret these signs, when<span id="Page_135" class="pagenum">[135]</span>
it was suddenly whispered that a German Red
Cross sister had come on an official tour of
inspection. As she entered, we all stood up to
honour her. In that remote and inclement land,
amid all the dangers with which we were surrounded,
not a man of us but was moved at the
sight of a fellow-countrywoman, speaking our own
language, and bringing with her into the squalor
of our barracks some suggestion of home. Her
opening words deepened the impression. “I have
come,” she said, “to remind you that you are not
forgotten in the Fatherland.” And then she
went on with the professional society lady’s fine
air and as if she were only repeating words learnt
off by heart: “Your Kaiser does not forget you,
and the dear Crown Prince thinks of you every
day.” A thrill of contempt ran through our ranks.
We had been expecting the bread of sympathy,
and she offered us the stone of an aristocrat’s
patronage. In one respect it saved the situation,
for it calmed our feelings and enabled us both to
speak to her and watch her depart unconcerned.
She did obtain some alleviation of our lot; for
instance, she persuaded the Russians to dismiss
and punish the soldier who kept the bath-house
and had to be tipped before he would allow us
inside. Arrangements were also made that the
N.C.O.s and educated privates were to receive
small sums of money, varying according to their
rank. The common soldier was to receive<span id="Page_136" class="pagenum">[136]</span>
nothing. Our working-men were justly incensed
at this favouritism, because their need was just as
great as anybody else’s. The working-men have
good memories for injustices of this kind, and in
the final settlement with the bourgeois they will
not be forgotten. The arrangement did not last
long, and after a month or so everybody was
thrown on his own resources, unless he chose to
beg from the Red Cross. I understand that the
British Government allowed all of their prisoners
in Germany without exception a weekly sum.
When our working-men heard how much better
the English prisoners were treated, they became
very bitter against their Government. I asked
the sister to get the Russians to separate the
educated soldiers from the uneducated, as had
been done with the Austrians. I said we were
quite willing to work, but we wanted to be our
own masters. She made some excuse, and the
proposal dropped for the time. When the working-men
heard about it, they were furious and
threatened to kill the man who had brought it
forward, if they ever discovered his name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRISON OUTFIT</div>

<p>And then one great day there arrived two
Swedish Red Cross sisters with unlimited money
at their command and wonderful parcels for us
all. We received a complete outfit for prison life
in Siberia, changes of warm linen, knitted helmets,
gloves, boots, soap, towels, spoon, fork, basin,
pencils, postcards, sewing-materials. Besides,<span id="Page_137" class="pagenum">[137]</span>
there was for every one who desired it a uniform
and a mantle. The old blue uniforms discarded
for active service had been sent to clothe the
prisoners of war. The Russian soldiers were
amazed. They said, “When war started, we
received a uniform and two changes of linen, and
now these are all in rags and our Government
gives us nothing. But you are prisoners of war,
thousands of miles away from home, and you are
as well looked after by your Government as if
you were still at the front.” A great trade was
done in the Red Cross gifts, especially when the
parcels began to arrive from home, and the
spring came with the warmer weather. Many a
Russian soldier that year went to the front clad
from head to foot in garments which had been
collected for us through the loving self-sacrifice
of the women of Germany. Those prisoners who
kept their things were much more smartly dressed
than the Russians set to guard them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TYPHUS</div>

<p>But all these improvements came too late.
Typhus had already got such a hold of the camp
that it was impossible to stamp it out quickly;
one could only let it run its course. The disease
began in another camp on the hills overlooking
Stretensk on the opposite side of the river. This
camp had been built as a temporary summer
residence for refugees; in winter it was next to
impossible to heat the barracks or to fetch water.
For days men would only be able to quench their<span id="Page_138" class="pagenum">[138]</span>
thirst by breaking off the ice on the windows and
sucking it. The first patients came down to our
camp to be treated, and not finding a doctor
ready to receive them, went all over the place
looking for friends, and so brought infection to
every barracks.</p>

<p>The horrors of Wittenberg have made the
disease known to all English readers. The
Germans call it “fleck-typhus,” <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> spotted
typhus, because on the third or fourth day small
red spots appear on the forearm and other parts
of the body. But until these spots appear, the
disease is often hard to distinguish from influenza,
and the doctors hesitated at first to put the
patients in the typhus-ward, but kept them in an
observation hospital instead. One man in an
observation ward was sufficient to infect all the
rest, so that many, who had only influenza to
begin with, caught typhus at the hospital. This
got to be known, and the men would not report
themselves ill so long as they could contrive to
stay in the barracks, which of course only spread
the disease still further. There is a kind of
delirium characteristic of typhus, in which the
patient gets out of bed and seeks some place
familiar to him. Often they used to get up, rush
out into the icy Siberian night and go back to
their barracks, thus again spreading the disease.
Their comrades, in terror of their lives, used to
chase them out, and sometimes they would be<span id="Page_139" class="pagenum">[139]</span>
unable to reach their hospitals, their strength
would fail, and they would fall dead on the path.
Typhus searches out the weak parts of the body
and its sequelæ may be almost as dangerous
as the disease itself. Many men, after finishing
with typhus, went on to inflammation of the lungs,
enteric, or tuberculosis, others were partially
paralysed, all will carry some mark of it down with
them to their graves. After the epidemic had
passed, the camp was full of cripples.</p>

<p>In fairness to the Russians it must be said
that as soon as they realized the danger, they did
everything in their power to fight the epidemic.
They sent a special hospital staff with doctors,
nurses, and beds complete. Some of the Russians
contracted the disease themselves while nursing
the prisoners of war. The Russian doctor was
constantly in and out of the hospitals, although
he was a married man with a wife and children
to whom he might easily have brought the disease.
German, Austrian, and Turkish doctors were
gathered from various parts of Siberia and sent
post haste to Stretensk. In a short time there
were twenty doctors and medical students at work.
The Swedish Red Cross provided medicines and
stores, and gave a large amount of money. Theoretically
it was always possible to obtain more by
telegraphing to the Central Red Cross Bureau at
Petrograd, but I doubt if a telegram would have
gone through. A number of buildings were fitted<span id="Page_140" class="pagenum">[140]</span>
up as hospitals and observation wards, so that it
became possible to separate the various infectious
diseases from one another. But at the best
everything remained primitive and rough. The
prisoners used to say that the Russians were
doing it on purpose in order to kill them off as
soon as possible. They forgot that they were
living in the wilds of Siberia, and that the Russian
soldiers themselves would have been no better
off if an epidemic had broken out amongst them.
The sanitary conditions were indescribable. At
the height of the plague there were three patients
to two beds, and you might wake up one night
to find a dead man on either side of you, and so
you would lie through the long hours till morning
came. The corpses were taken to a little wooden
house and there kept for weeks. There was a
gruesome story of an Austrian who went to
plunder the dead and got shut up for a whole
day among the stacks of corpses. The ground
was frozen too hard for a spade to turn, so all
night we could see the glare of the fires on the
hills burning a hole into the frozen ground to
make graves for the dead. Only officers were
buried with a religious service. We used to see
the dead bodies of our comrades fetched out of
the morgue and flung like so many sides of bacon
on to a sledge and borne off to the graveyard,
where they were thrown into the earth without
any ceremony. “Did these bones cost no more<span id="Page_141" class="pagenum">[141]</span>
the breeding, but to play at loggats with ’em?
Mine ache to think on’t.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">JEWS AS ORDERLIES</div>

<p>But gloomy as the picture was, it was made
still darker by the treachery of our own men.
There was no trained hospital staff at first, and it
was necessary to take for orderlies men who could
speak Russian. The only prisoners who fulfilled
this qualification were Austrian and Hungarian
Jews. They could speak Russian, partly because
a Jew can always learn a language when it is
likely to bring him any advantage, but also because
they were the first to desert and had been the
longest in captivity. Where one Jew comes,
others follow, and in time practically all the
orderly work was in their hands. Whatever the
patients brought with them to hospital was stolen
as a matter of course. Their fine new uniforms
were taken away on a pretence that they were to
be disinfected, but they were never brought back.
The Jews sold them, and gave the patients that
recovered torn and shabby garments for which
there was no sale. They ate the nourishing
rations provided for the sick, and left their
patients to starve. The biggest scoundrel was
a man called Flesch. Sometimes Flesch would
load a sledge with Red Cross stores, such as rugs
or warm underclothing, drive off to the town and
sell to the Russians the things of which his own
comrades stood in such bitter need. By some
queer stroke of cunning he managed to keep the<span id="Page_142" class="pagenum">[142]</span>
orderlies in his hospital under subjection, and no
one stole without his licence. Honour among
thieves! When a man died, Flesch was fetched
to dispose of his effects, and a certain ritual was
always observed in these affairs. If he left much
money, Flesch would say a long prayer for his
soul; if little, he would turn away with a sneer
and say that as he had left only a few kopecks,
a short paternoster would be enough for him.
The Catholics may find what consolation they
can in the circumstance that this master rogue
was of their Church, although he was undoubtedly
of Jewish descent. There were horrible ghoulish
stories at the hospitals of patients who did not
die quickly enough, and of orderlies hovering round
their bed, waiting for them to breathe their last,
and then suddenly losing patience, rushing in on
them and snatching their money from them while
they still lived, or even taking their pillow and
hastening their end by suffocation. Now and
again the patients resisted, and, with a strength
born of despair, would just be able to throw off
their assailants before they died. And some recovered
and lived to remember, as through the
mists of an awful dream, in what terrors Death
can be arrayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN DOCTORS</div>

<p>But even worse remains to be told. I have
already mentioned that the Swedish sisters left
a large sum of money at Stretensk. If this had
been properly spent, a great deal of suffering<span id="Page_143" class="pagenum">[143]</span>
might have been prevented. Strong nourishing
food might have been bought for those who were
not yet ill, and the disease would not have spread
so quickly. The Austrian doctors in our camp
made good use of the little money they received.
In the other camp on the hill there was a German
Jew, Dr. Kallenbach, and he is said to have
wheedled out of the sisters enormous sums. A
portion of the money was ear-marked for definite
purposes, but even this he contrived in part to
embezzle. He was instructed to give every qualified
doctor £10, he only gave them £5. He
had orders to give a certain amount to the Turkish
prisoners, who were worse off than any of us;
most of this money he kept for himself, and then
falsified his accounts so as to make it appear that
the Turks had received everything. No one
knows exactly how much he stole. A certain
proportion, of course, found its way to the prisoners
for whom it was intended. The rest Kallenbach
is said to have invested with a chemist living at
Stretensk, a Jew with whom he was on intimate
terms. If so, the local Soviet has probably
scattered it to the four winds by now. While
the common prisoners in Kallenbach’s camp were
starving, their doctors were enjoying the best of
everything. Their banquets became a byword.
The doctors down in our camp messed for eighteen
roubles a month each, and for this sum lived as
luxuriously as ever at home. The doctors on the<span id="Page_144" class="pagenum">[144]</span>
hill messed for thirty-five roubles a month. It is
a puzzle to me, with food as cheap as it was then,
where they got the appetite to eat at all.</p>

<p>What knavery had begun, cowardice completed.
The other German doctor, a Gentile
this time, when he saw that the disease really was
typhus, proclaimed himself ill and took to his bed.
He stayed there for some months, until all danger
was past. He asserted that he himself had
typhus. The Russian doctors laughed and
declared it was impossible, but with characteristic
good nature they left him alone. He was the
only doctor who had received the Iron Cross.
He had a young medical student, Heinze by
name, who waited on him all through his illness,
practically taking sole charge of him. When he
got home again, he was going to recommend this
man for the Iron Cross too&mdash;“for devotion to
duty in trying circumstances.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNSPEAKABLE TURK</div>

<p>Another arrant coward was the Turkish doctor,
Remsi Seki. He was said to be a son of Abdul
Hamid. Whether that is true I do not know;
but at any rate his mother had been in the Sultan’s
harem and had afterwards been married off to
a high official. He was the most contemptible
poltroon I have ever met. At a certain stage in
the reconvalescence from typhus an abscess often
forms in the neck, and death ensues from suffocation
if it is not lanced in time. It is a very
simple operation, which anybody can perform.<span id="Page_145" class="pagenum">[145]</span>
When cases of this kind occurred, Remsi Seki
used to stand wringing his hands, looking at the
patient in terror, unable to move. At last, after
a number of patients had died through his incompetence,
the orderlies themselves, untrained as
they were, would rush in and do the lancing.
After a while he was dismissed from the hospital
as utterly useless. He was the typical “unspeakable
Turk,” a man of gentle and winning manners,
affecting shyness as good form in Turkey requires,
shrewd at judging the weaknesses of others, but
incapable of strong action himself, though tenacious
in his purposes, given over to unmentionable vice,
and at heart terribly cruel. When he heard of
the Armenian massacres he expressed his joy and
said they were quite <a id="Ref_145">justified</a>. None of his bad
qualities prevented him from being a prime
favourite with the Germans, who used to extol
his fine and noble character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALL SOULS’ DAY</div>

<p>But it must not be supposed that all the
doctors were like these Jews and Turks. There
was another side to the medal. The Austrians
worked manfully to stem the tide of disease. And
there were examples of heroic self-sacrifice, worthy
to rank with any deeds on the battlefield. There
was the Austrian officer <a id="Ref_145a">Herrman</a>, who at the
outbreak of the epidemic volunteered to help in
disinfecting the barracks. He was over forty,
and he must have known that he had little chance
of life if he caught the disease. He went from<span id="Page_146" class="pagenum">[146]</span>
barracks to barracks, doing his utmost to better
the circumstances of the men, always ready with
a joke or a cheery word of advice. He fought
the causes of the disease, the dirt, the bad air, the
vermin, the prisoners’ sloth and the indifference
they displayed to their condition. Such a fight
could not last long, the inevitable happened, and
he perished of the disease. Other Austrian
medical students also succumbed. Of these we
may surely use the phrase so hackneyed in
Germany and say that they died a hero’s death
for the Fatherland. Their gravestone stands on
the bleak Siberian hillside, an enduring memorial
to their courage, a reproach to their less worthy
comrades. Every year on All Souls’ Day, the
Catholics in Austria and Germany celebrate their
Feast of the Dead. Lights are placed on the
graves and sometimes food is set out. In old
days the people thought that on this festival the
spirits of the dead revisited the earth, and the
lights were to guide and the food to sustain them
on their long journey. On All Souls’ Day, 1916,
the Russians, who under the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> always
respected religious observances, allowed the
medical staff to leave the camp and go up to the
graves on the hill. We found the candles burning
just as at home, and we all stood with bared heads
in reverence to the dead. The scene was penetrated
with a mournful irony. Below slept the
unfortunate and the brave, and there came to do<span id="Page_147" class="pagenum">[147]</span>
them honour the cowards who had deserted them,
the thieves who had robbed them, and the
murderer who had killed them just as certainly as
if he had driven a sword into their hearts.</p>

<p>I have said so much against the Germans that
it is a pleasure to bear witness to the courage
of two of their numbers. Heinze, the student
already mentioned, was surpassed by no one in
his attention to the sick. He had caught so
many diseases during the various epidemics he
had fought, that people would think I was
romancing if I were to give the list. And there
was a young student of philosophy from Bonn
who had the orderlies under him at a particular
hospital. He waged a perpetual warfare with the
Jews, doing his utmost to prevent them from
robbing the patients of food and money. He
spared himself neither day nor night, and was so
heedless of danger that at last his doctor had to
give him an express command to keep out of
the sick-room. In the end the Jews were too
strong for him, and they intrigued him out of
his position.</p>

<p>It will never be known how many the
epidemic carried off, because at first the men died
so quickly that they could not be counted. The
doctors estimated that in three months eight
hundred men, or ten per cent. of the prisoners,
died. The disease being not particularly virulent,
the mortality was only about twenty per cent. of<span id="Page_148" class="pagenum">[148]</span>
the patients. We may reckon that about half the
camp caught typhus. We have only guesswork
to go upon, because the dishonest doctors
intentionally falsified their sick-lists. The Jewish
hospital orderlies, who had undertaken the work
merely to enrich themselves, nearly all perished.
Some time in the winter of 1916 a prisoner found
smuggled in a parcel he had received from home,
a German newspaper containing the Red Cross
Report on conditions in Siberia. It accused the
Russian hospital attendants of infamous cruelty,
scandalous neglect of their duties, and shameless
thieving. The Austrian doctors got hold of the
report and read it to one another with shouts of
laughter. “Why,” they said, “it wasn’t the
Russians who did that, it was our own men. The
Russians wouldn’t hurt a fly.” I suppose the
same thought has occurred to all my readers.
This story makes the horrors of Wittenberg intelligible.
You cannot expect the Germans to be
kinder to the English than to their own soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTMAS CHEER</div>

<p>It was always a puzzle to us afterwards how
we could have passed through that time so light-heartedly.
We saw our comrades, suddenly
stricken with the disease, stagger off to hospital,
a day or two afterwards we saw their corpses flung
on to the sledge and hurried away to be buried
with less ceremony than a dog. Or, if they came
back, it was as broken and crippled men, shadows
of their former selves. We knew that any<span id="Page_149" class="pagenum">[149]</span>
moment the same thing might happen to us.
And yet we were outwardly as merry as the day
was long, and we were never without a song or a
jest on our lips. That peculiar numbness of
prison life, which I mentioned in my last chapter,
kept us from feeling our position too acutely.
But when everything was over, a strange horror
of it all took possession of us, and we could not
bear to look back. One incident stands out
especially in my memory. It was months after
the epidemic had finished. We had just been
celebrating Christmas; the dinner had been excellent,
probably far better than any of our
families at home had been able to procure, and
we were in that warm and comfortable frame of
mind which a good Christmas dinner usually
brings about. Suddenly some one observed,
“Why, of all us ten, Price is the only one who
didn’t get fleck-typhus.” Our talk and laughter
instantly stopped, and our evening’s amusement
was killed. Once more the grave seemed lo
open at our feet, and Death to take his place
beside us, a familiar guest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEACHING ENGLISH</div>

<p>A strange turn of Fortune’s wheel delivered me
from the worst of the epidemic. There was at
Stretensk an officers’ camp, jealously guarded, to
which ordinary prisoners were not allowed access.
The Hungarian officers, when they heard of me,
petitioned the colonel in command that I might
be allowed to go and give them lessons in English.
The colonel refused even to consider it. Then
one day a Hungarian officer came to me with the
following proposal: We will transfer you to our
camp by putting you down on the list of officers’
servants; once you are with us, however, you will
live as an officer and be treated quite as one of
ourselves. I lost no time in accepting, was
immediately transferred, and became for the
Russians an officer in the Austro-Hungarian
Army.</p>

<p>At that time no letters had arrived from home,
the Red Cross work was still unorganized, and
very few prisoners knew of the existence of Frau
von Hanneken’s organization, so that there was a
great dearth of amusements, and people were only
too eager to learn English. I soon had five
classes a day. I had no grammars and no books<span id="Page_151" class="pagenum">[151]</span>
of any sort to teach from and had to make up
every lesson out of my own head. But the hard
work was an undisguised blessing, it enabled me
to forget where I was, and the days began to pass
more quickly.</p>

<p>The cheat we were practising could not long
be concealed from our guards. Every officer
had to sign his name in a book twice a day. The
soldier, whose business it was to bring this book
round, was bound to notice that I never signed it.
He was easily pacified. The Russian state paid
him seventy kopecks (about 1<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>) a month for
his services. I bought them for a rouble a month,
with occasional tips for odd jobs. He was only
dangerous when in his drunken fits, which were
not infrequent. Then he would burst suddenly
into the class and point at me and say, “You
are not an officer, you are a teacher; you are a
naughty man, but I will forgive you. Come, let
us shake hands.” After we had shaken hands, he
would minutely examine his greasy palms to see
what might be found there. Once he came in
maudlin sorrow and said, “You make me very
unhappy, you give my conscience no rest. I want
to go to church to-night and cannot. God does
not love me, God will be very angry with me&mdash;unless
you give me twenty-five roubles at once.”
“Well,” I said, “how about twenty-five kopecks?”
His purple face lighted up with joy and he was
again my friend. He was not always to be<span id="Page_152" class="pagenum">[152]</span>
bought, however. One night he came storming
into our rooms, more drunk than usual. He
called us to get up (it was about two o’clock) and
said he would take us into the town on the spree.
Then he caught sight of me, and shouted, “No, I
cannot take you, you have that wicked man among
you. I must go to the colonel and tell him all
about it.” In his drunken frenzy he seemed quite
capable of carrying out his threat, and no bribes
or cajoleries of ours had any effect. At last we
hit upon the expedient of treating him as his own
officers did, and bullied him hard. We beat his
soft will to pulp, and before long, trembling with
fear, he began to fall on his knees and kiss our
hands, begging us to overlook his offence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITH THE DOCTORS</div>

<p>Such scenes gave me a distaste for the life I
was leading. I felt that immunity from typhus
could be too dearly bought. Further, while the
Hungarian officers treated me with finished
courtesy, even with a sort of deference as to their
teacher, the Germans took a pleasure in embittering
my life in all the ways they could. Proverbially
we can find strength to support the afflictions
of our friends, it is their good fortune that is so
hard to bear. The Germans simply could not
forgive me my stroke of luck. When, therefore,
the Austrian doctors approached me with an offer
that I should live with them, going into the
officers’ camp every day to give my lessons, I
was very glad. My evenings and Sundays I<span id="Page_153" class="pagenum">[153]</span>
spent with the doctors. Every morning a doctor
went to visit the officers, I, with a Red Cross
band round my arm, marching behind, ostentatiously
carrying a big bottle of medicine. Every
day the sentry challenged me, and every day the
doctor answered in the only two words of Russian
he knew, “My servant.” Every afternoon he
came to fetch me back, every afternoon the sentry
challenged us, and every afternoon he answered
in the only two words of Russian he knew, “My
servant.” The medicine had originally been
intended for some officer, but it proved to me
such a magic “Open Sesame,” that he had to go
without. From time to time the Russians were
seized with a suspicion that unauthorized people
were on the premises and they would make surprise
visits. They would order everybody out
of the buildings and call the roll in the courtyard.
In the meantime the soldiers would search the
empty barracks for people who ought not to be
there, see me quietly reading, give me a brotherly
grin, and pass on to the next room. Once during
these proceedings I was carelessly standing at the
window, when a soldier down below recognized
me. He made frantic signs to get out of the
way, lest his officers should catch sight of me.
Wrongheadedness and topsyturvydom could go
no further.</p>

<p>Everything comes to an end at last, and so did
this double life. Five officers had planned to<span id="Page_154" class="pagenum">[154]</span>
escape. They had arranged with the sentry that
each should pay him twenty kopecks. The first
four paid and got through, but the last one, being
a Jew, objected to paying and scrambled by for
nothing. The sentry promptly rang the alarm-bell.
The colonel was the first to arrive and he
found the sentry in tears. He demanded to know
what was the matter. “Why, just think,” said
the sentry, “five Austrian officers promised to
give me twenty kopecks if I would let them
escape (boo-hoo-hoo), and I did let them escape
(boo-hoo-hoo), and then the last one did not pay
me anything at all (boo-hoo-hoo).” The colonel,
quite properly I think, boxed his ears, and
degraded him on the spot. The Russians were
very angry with the escaped officers and wished
to make an example of them. They could not
find out their names because all the books had
already been signed up, and they were not equal
to the task of going through each room and
finding out who belonged there and who was
missing. But they set round the officers’ quarters
double guards and enjoined on them the necessity
of keeping a sharp watch. In spite of the care
they took, all the fugitives managed to slip back
into the camp that night unperceived. Then the
Russians, determined to have no more nonsense
from the officers, built all round their camp a
wooden enclosure some ten or fifteen feet high,
and strengthened it at short intervals with towers<span id="Page_155" class="pagenum">[155]</span>
from which sentries could overlook the whole
section. There was only one entrance, a massive
gateway, and this was always watched by four or
five men. My career as a teacher of officers was
at an end, and from that time till I left Stretensk
I lived with the doctors. All the Russians in the
camp except the colonel knew that I was there
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per nefas</i>, but it made no difference. I even
gave lessons in the families of Russian officers.
At first the attitude of the Russians puzzled me,
and I put it down to that peculiar element in the
Russian character which, according to the circumstances
in which we meet it, we call good nature,
or fatalism, or simply laziness. But in the end I
found out that nearly all the officers were there
for a special reason; they were Poles, or Jews, or
Germans, or political suspects, and had been sent
to Siberia partly as a punishment, partly to get
them out of harm’s way. A few of them favoured
the German cause, some came from districts
occupied by the Germans, and would naturally
not be inclined to do anything to prejudice their
position with their German rulers. There was a
Polish officer who rejoiced at every German
victory, and wished disaster to the Russians more
heartily than the prisoners themselves.</p>

<p>The Russians were subtler than we gave them
credit for. They ringed in the officers with a
high fence in order to prevent escape, but they
also used finer means. They told us fearful and<span id="Page_156" class="pagenum">[156]</span>
wonderful tales of the Buriat tribes swarming
between us and the Chinese frontier. These men
were so fierce, they said, that they would murder
you for the sake of a button, and then they would
bury you somewhere in the vast desert, and no
one would ever know your fate. The Chinese
smugglers and bandits were still worse, for, with
a refinement of cruelty denied to the less developed
Buriats, they would put you to exquisite
torture before killing you. These stories the
Russians would pour in upon us with such a
ready, unpremeditated air, such wealth of gesture,
with so much humour and goodfellowship, that
they inevitably carried conviction. Chinese tobacco-smugglers
used to come to us and offer to
convey us across the frontier for three hundred
roubles; but we never dreamt of listening to
them. People who know the country intimately
have since told me that these stories were pure
inventions, that the Buriats are a comparatively
harmless race, on whose honesty one could rely,
and that the smugglers would probably have kept
their part of the bargain if we had kept ours. A
spice of danger there would naturally have been
in adventuring with them, but not more than was
pleasant. The officers were eager to escape,
because those who succeeded got a step in rank.
It was perfectly easy to buy from a Russian
soldier his uniform and equipment, but not his
mastery of the Russian language. Most of the<span id="Page_157" class="pagenum">[157]</span>
enterprises failed because the prisoners were
forced sooner or later to buy food, and the
moment they began to speak with the natives,
their accent betrayed them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FUGITIVES</div>

<p>The climax of these attempts to escape was
such a story as has never been heard of outside
“Alice in Wonderland,” or the “Arabian Nights.”
After several other enterprises had been frustrated
by difficulties about food, some officers conceived
the idea of carrying with them on their own
persons enough to last them into China. We
used to compute the distance at nearly two
hundred miles. Our maps were very primitive,
and our only idea of the route was to strike south.
The officers began to collect tinned meats gradually,
so as not to excite suspicion. They also
managed to get hold of several pounds of a hard
sort of sausage, called in German, “Dauerwurst.”
Besides, they reasoned out that, as they were not
to go near any building all the way, they would
be obliged to wear enough clothes to keep them
warm while sleeping in the open. So they started
off, bulging mountainous with the extra clothes
they wore, swathed round with sausage, packed
tight with tins of corned beef and Bismarck herring,
till they looked more like knights in a pantomime
than anything else. The Russians soon discovered
that some prisoners had escaped, and
ordered the officers out in order to count how
many they were. Arithmetic is a thing the<span id="Page_158" class="pagenum">[158]</span>
Russian does not shine at; the officers did their
best to create confusion by continually moving
about and making a noise, and in the end the
Russians, instead of counting seven too few,
made it twenty-five too many. They did not
know what to do, so they sent in a report that
they had counted twenty-five too many, which
they explained by supposing that twenty-five
officers were away ill in hospital. This calculation
was beyond me, but as I also am weak at
mathematics, I leave it where it is. Meanwhile
the Cossacks had been alarmed, and they started
off in pursuit, plunging through the camp on their
hardy Siberian ponies, and we soon saw their
scattered parties scouring the hills. Even a fox-hunt
will seem tame to me now, after I have
smelt the excitement of a man-hunt. The fugitives
had bribed a soldier into letting them have
a sledge and horses, but that only took them
a day’s journey. Then they proceeded on foot,
sleeping by day and marching by night. In that
glittering, smooth expanse of snow their tracks
were easily picked up, and, burdened as they
were, they could not hope to shake off their pursuers.
The Cossacks surrounded them, but
dared not attack them, and so the two parties
lay for some time intently watching one another.
Finally the fugitives stood up and showed that
they were unarmed, and the Cossacks were emboldened
to approach them. Then began a<span id="Page_159" class="pagenum">[159]</span>
characteristic scene. They began trying to bribe
the Cossacks into letting them go. But the
Cossacks were coy, and made a great show of
offended honour, and by artful bargaining put the
price up until they had wrung the last kopeck out
of the fugitives. Then, penniless, but still rich in
clothes and sausages, the prisoners were ordered
to march back to camp.</p>

<p>So far as I remember, only one attempt at
escape on a large scale was really successful.
That was when some officers hired a motor-boat
to take them down the Amur till they reached
Chinese territory. At the same time two other
officers were to put the Russians on a false scent
by starting off by train and getting captured some
way down the line. The trick succeeded to perfection;
the Russians continued to search for the
other fugitives on the railroad, and the men in
the motor-boat got clear away to Manchuria, and
eventually to Tientsin. In the spring of 1917,
after the first Revolution, an order from the
Austrian and German Governments was circulated
through the Siberian camps that no more
prisoners were to escape to China, as they would
only be interned, and the camps there were much
worse than in Russia. Whether there was any
political motive behind this order I do not know,
but in the summer of 1917 those prisoners who
wanted to escape went westwards through Russia.
There was a brisk trade in forged passports,<span id="Page_160" class="pagenum">[160]</span>
Russian or English by preference, and it was
easy to get to Petrograd. I do not think it would
have been so easy if there had been more
English consuls in Siberia to look after matters
of this sort. How the prisoners managed to
cross the frontier from Petrograd I do not understand.
It was quite impossible on an Allied
passport. But the letters we received from
Germany proved that somehow or other they did
get home at last.</p>

<p>The frequent attempts at escape, like my
surreptitious life, can only be understood by those
who know the venality with which the Russian
state was honey-combed. Chehof has a sparklingly
malicious story of a Russian gentleman
who goes to a Government office to make some
inquiries. He is shown into a room where several
officials are busy writing. He wanders about for
a long time, ignored by every one. Finally he
receives a hint from the porter that a gratification
is expected. He lays a banknote on the desk of
one of the officials, who adroitly slips a book over
it and goes on writing. At first he does not
understand this manœuvre, but light breaks in
upon his mind, and he lays a banknote for a much
larger sum on the desk. The official wakes up
as from a trance, recognizes his visitor, does the
necessary little piece of business, and escorts him
to the corridor. The gentleman is so overwhelmed
by his politeness and condescension that<span id="Page_161" class="pagenum">[161]</span>
he feels obliged, on leaving, to convey to him still
another gratification.... Such, or something
like this, is Chehof’s story.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“HAMPELMANN”</div>

<p>Our colonel was a nobleman who had seen
much service, and when he was in full dress, his
uniform was decked out with a fine array of orders
and medals. In person he was diminutive and
bandy-legged, but he had the aristocrat’s clear-cut,
energetic features, flashing eyes, and delicate,
well-kept hands. But he was chiefly distinguished
by his long, white, exquisitely silken whiskers.
Diminutiveness, whiskers, energy, bandy-legs
combined to make him irresistibly comic to our
men, who used to call him the “Hampelmann”
(monkey on a stick). In drunkenness he yielded
nothing to his soldiers, and I have seen him reeling
through the camp, after a night spent over
the bottle, denouncing punishments on everybody
who crossed his path. When he was angry he
used to draw his sword and strike with a scythe-like
sweep at our legs. We easily ran away from
him, and, once we were at a safe distance, there
was not a soldier would have lifted a finger to
bring us back to him again. For an officer and a
nobleman his career had been peculiar. He had
been commandant of the camp at Dauria, where
suspicion had fallen upon him of embezzling state
funds. His accomplice, a Greek civilian, was
sentenced to a long term of penal servitude, while
he himself had been punished by being removed<span id="Page_162" class="pagenum">[162]</span>
to Stretensk. Here he transferred his attentions
to the money of the prisoners. All the sums
sent to us were kept in the bank a certain period,
until he had received his percentage on them. He
was always issuing regulations cutting down the
amount of money we might receive a month. At
one time it was no more than five roubles. His
accomplice at Stretensk was a banker from China,
who, I regret to say, belonged to the Church of
England. He was probably what the Jews call
an Old-Protestant, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> one who has been baptized
comparatively late in life. This amiable pair
used to buy sugar for the camp at low rates long
before it was needed, and then sell on a rising
market, and the prisoners would have to go without.
Once, however, the general on his tour of
inspection discovered that the prisoners had no
sugar, and the colonel had to buy it all back again
on a market that had meanwhile risen considerably.
The meat rations of the prisoners were
regularly cut down far below what the Government
allowed, and the difference went to fill the
pockets of the colonel and his friends. They also
kept pigs in the camp, and it was believed that
the bread supplied to us was so bad in order that
we might the more readily be induced to feed the
colonel’s pigs with it. As a rule, we found that
the officers who were hard with us were worse to
their own men, and it is certain that the Russians
hated the colonel far more than we. They used<span id="Page_163" class="pagenum">[163]</span>
to tell us that he was afraid of going out at night
because he was sure to be killed if he did. This
seems fantastic; but the fact remains that he never
came to us after dark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMP OFFICIALS</div>

<p>The colonel did not stand alone, there was
corruption in every branch of the administration.
The hospital kitchen was in the hands of a Polish
Jew and his wife. They had begun the war with
almost nothing, and they were now said to be
worth thousands of pounds. No money was paid
by the kitchen but some stuck to their palms.
His staff collected money for a water carrier, and
gave it to him to disburse. He put it in his own
pocket, and used to pay the man out of Government
funds. His soldiers were so angry with him
that at the outbreak of the Revolution he was one
of the first they impeached. He was sent to
Irkutsk to await his trial, but the case dragged
on interminably. After the Bolsheviks came in
he was released, and when I last heard of him he
was occupying some position under their Government.</p>

<p>Like master, like man. The minor officials
squeezed all the money out of us they could. If
a window was broken in a barracks, they fined
every prisoner who lived there, and reaped a sum
sufficient to glaze all the windows in the camp.
The Russian clerks in the colonel’s office treated
us just as if we had been Russians ourselves.
Every petition had to be accompanied by a tip<span id="Page_164" class="pagenum">[164]</span>
adapted to the importance of what you wanted,
otherwise it simply found its way to the waste-paper
basket. The prisoners took advantage of
these customs to spin intrigues against one another
with the Russians. A German medical student
made application to be considered as such, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>
that he should be removed from the stuffy barracks
to the doctors’ quarters, receive a salary, and
enjoy considerable privileges. He accompanied
this application with ten roubles for the clerk.
Heinze, the medical student I have already mentioned,
was jealous of his colleague, so he overtipped
him, and gave the clerk twenty roubles to
keep the application back. The clerk, of course,
pockets the twenty roubles, and then after some
time informs the first man how the matter stands.
So by whetting the one against the other he
reaped a golden profit. All our letters and parcels
had to be paid for by tips. If we stopped tipping,
we received nothing. The prisoners were, of
course, forbidden to send letters except through
the prisoners’ censorship, but all the while I was
at Stretensk I conducted with friends in England
an extensive correspondence that never went
through our censor’s hands. To put the Russians
off the scent I used to describe myself as a fur-merchant.
In one letter I pretended to be a lady,
wrote in a very round hand, underlined every
other word, and described how good Russian
eau-de-cologne was for my headaches. My<span id="Page_165" class="pagenum">[165]</span>
correspondents were mystified; I had offers of
capital for my fur business, and a letter of very
tender sympathy about my headaches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENALITY</div>

<p>In fact, everything had its tariff. The Regulations
existed only on paper. Those who wanted
to, and had enough money to pay for it, could go
into the town every day. It was simply a question
of establishing a connection with the soldiers, and
making your custom so valuable that they would
not like to lose it. The clerks in the colonel’s
office often came to me and threatened to denounce
me, if I did not pay them a certain sum down.
I pointed out that, if they did denounce me, they
would lose a profitable source of income, because,
once I had returned to the barracks, they would
make nothing out of me. After that they left me
alone. We were supposed, like everybody else in
Russia, to have two meatless days a week. A
certain amount of meat was weighed out and
handed over to us, and officially we were not
allowed to have any more. As a matter of fact,
we never confined ourselves to our rations, we
had meat every day and as much as we wanted.
Russian soldiers would come and sell us a whole
pig or a sheep at prices far below those ruling
in the market. We had great fun getting these
animals into our house without our guards noticing
it. It had to be done at night, windows had to be
wrenched from their frames, and sentries posted
all around to give warning of the approach of<span id="Page_166" class="pagenum">[166]</span>
obnoxious persons. Or if we wanted boots,
soldiers would supply us with the leather and get
them made for us at half what it would have cost
an ordinary Russian. We had our own ideas as
to how it was possible to supply us so cheaply,
and we never asked where the goods came from.
The peasant women kept us supplied with butter
at a time when the housewives in Stretensk could
get none. It was not done out of love for us, but
because we were ready to pay any price they asked.
The sale of alcohol was forbidden throughout
Russia, but whenever we wanted wine we got it.
The common prisoners were often cheated. One
of the guards would come up in the twilight and
offer a pound of sugar; you would buy it, and when
you got in you would find that they had passed
off on you a pound of salt or of sand. An enormous
trade was done in smuggling beer and confectionery
into the camp from the town, but it was
nearly always ruined by tale-bearers. Sooner or
later there would be a quarrel about the division
of profits; or even the mere sight of a comrade
getting rich would be enough to send some
Austrian Jew sneaking off to the Russians.</p>

<p>The prevailing dishonesty had its bitter consequences
for us. Our parcels from home scarcely
ever arrived intact. They were regularly plundered,
and the contents sold in the town. Once
a Chinese coolie appeared in the barracks in
order to sell us cigars from a box which still bore<span id="Page_167" class="pagenum">[167]</span>
the address to one of our number. My wife in
despair used to put a picture of St. Antony of
Padua in her parcels. She had heard that the
Russians were superstitious, and would respect
parcels protected by the saint. But their sense
of humour was still greater than their superstition,
and I used to receive parcels out of which everything
had been stolen but the picture of St. Antony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CORRUPT POLICE</div>

<p>We got strange and terrible glimpses of what
all this corruption meant for private Russians.
Our dentist was in need of instruments, and wished
to ask a lady dentist living in Stretensk to lend
him some. He could not approach her directly,
and was obliged to ask the Russians to act for
him. To his surprise they all refused point blank.
He could not understand why it was, and after
much pressure they told him the lady’s history.
Some years before she had been denounced to the
Secret Police, and they had made a raid on her
lodgings. They discovered nothing to justify
their suspicions, but they told her that if she did
not pay them blackmail they would report that
they had found certain incriminating documents
in her house. She indignantly refused, and, relying
on the justice of her cause, wrote an account of
the whole matter to the Governor-General at
Irkutsk. She so far succeeded in clearing herself
as to escape punishment in a court of law. But
from that time onwards she was a suspect, a
marked person, and no one in the Government<span id="Page_168" class="pagenum">[168]</span>
service durst have anything to do with her. Few
of the officers had much affection for the old
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, some were even Bolsheviks, and yet so
great was the terror exercised by the Secret Police,
that not one of them would speak to the lady.</p>

<p>The whole administration of the camp was
corrupt. Of all the officers I know only two that
were honest. One of these was a Bolshevik&mdash;the
regimental doctor. He was a poor man, and
might have acquired a fortune by declaring rich
recruits unfit for service, and yet he remained
resolutely and unchangeably loyal. Some men
were ready to pay £500 for such services. Everything
was forbidden and everything was allowed.
We were prisoners, and lived like lords. Whatever
of luxury or pleasure there was in Stretensk
we could enjoy, only we had to pay a little more
for it than ordinary mortals. Unlike ordinary
mortals we knew nothing of rent, taxes, or insurance,
we had neither wife nor child to clothe and
feed, and so it generally happened that what we
wanted we could pay for.</p>

<p>What a world! you say. A nobleman and
officer cheating prisoners of their food; the
common soldier falling in abject humiliation
and kissing the hands of the enemy he was
set to guard. Yes, that was Russia before the
Revolution.</p>

<p>I have often been asked how I managed to endure
the boredom of captivity, and few people believe
me when I answer that, far from being dull, it was
a period full of fascination. The camp in time
became like a great university, there was scarcely
a subject that was not studied, and on which you
could not inform yourself, through the books the
Red Cross sent us. And then there was the
spectacle of the Siberian seasons. We were said
to be living three or four thousand feet up, and
rain only fell on forty days in the year. In that
dry, crisp mountain air our senses acquired a
keener edge of enjoyment, and life a sparkle it
never had before. The year was a succession of
delightful surprises. In winter the sun shone, as
it seemed, with passion all day long in a sky of
cloudless and radiant blue. Through some rare
quality in the atmosphere the whole western
horizon at sunset glowed one rich and lively red&mdash;a
daily spectacle which alone made life in Siberia
worth while. The nights were even more wonderful;
the stars were so much brighter than at home
that it seemed as if we had never known them
before; and on moonlit nights the landscape with<span id="Page_170" class="pagenum">[170]</span>
its impressive contrast between the broad, glistening
snowfields and the sombre precipices rising
above the river, was almost sublime. Spring
came; the camp was smothered in white blossom,
and the hills were purple with autumn crocus and
rhododendron. Never again can spring be so
intoxicating as in that year; life, which had been
dammed up by the gloom and horrors of winter,
suddenly raced along like a cataract. In summer
we heard the cuckoo calling from the woods all
day, and in the evening we enjoyed a rare luxury.
At sunset a chill north wind set in, chasing away
the almost intolerable heat of the afternoon, and
bringing from the forest scents of birch, bracken,
and strange aromatic shrubs. These evenings
were the climax of the year. Then, with dramatic
suddenness, came autumn; forest and field turned
a brilliant yellow (there are no dull colours in those
hills; everything strikes vivid and sharp). As
suddenly autumn disappeared; as if by magic the
trees were leafless and the corn gathered in, and
the desolation of winter had begun. We lived a
double life, enjoying this feast of the senses, while
within us changes were going on which only
gradually became apparent. Men not yet thirty
began to grow grey, while those approaching
middle age began to look like old men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN PROPAGANDA</div>

<p>At Stretensk, too, there were concentrated
representatives of all the races at war from
Hamburg to Baghdad, and merely to live with<span id="Page_171" class="pagenum">[171]</span>
them was a political education. First of all,
there were the Russians. With the common
soldier we were on the best of terms. This
brought us several advantages, but to the Russians
only harm. The prisoners of war exercised a
steady corrupting influence. Many a Russian
soldier left Stretensk for the front provided with
letters recommending him, in case of capture, to
mercy and good usage, because he had treated
the Germans or Austrians decently. Our men
used to spin the Russians wonderful yarns of
what a paradise Germany was for prisoners of
war. They did their best to terrify their guards
by telling them tales of mysterious German inventions,
against which it was impossible for the
Russians to fight. Even before the Revolution,
the complete breakdown of the Russian Army had
been prepared for by the work of the prisoners.
The higher classes of society were corrupted in a
subtler way by the love-affairs of the prisoners.
There were daughters of Stretensk manufacturers
whose lovers had quite brought them round to an
anti-Russian and especially anti-English point of
view. I met one of these girls later on at Irkutsk,
and she was an effective pro-German propagandist.
Her talk was filled with sneers against England
and Italy, from which I inferred that of her lovers
one had been a German and another an Austrian.
The women whose husbands were away at the
front were the worst. Much was written about<span id="Page_172" class="pagenum">[172]</span>
it at the time in the newspapers, but no reports
ever came near the truth. I do not know if I
should call these grass widows cynical, but they
certainly made no attempt to keep up appearances.
Watching them, I recalled Milioukof’s famous
words, “In Russia we lack the binding cement
of a common hypocrisy.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUSSIAN SOLDIERS</div>

<p>Outwardly, nothing seemed so firmly established
and vigorous as the Russian State. The
drills went with a swing; on the march the
soldiers sang their fiery patriotic songs as only
Slavs can sing, and every day closed with the
traditional prayers and the solemn music of “God
save the Czar.” But there were already indications
of the direction events were about to take.
The men never concealed from us their hatred of
their officers, and in public their officers did not
spare one another. There was once to be a
review, and we were allowed to watch it. A
subaltern superintends the drawing up of the
troops and reports to the captain that everything
is ready. The captain gives a hasty glance at
the men and raps out a terrible Russian oath,
which I could not possibly translate. “&mdash;&mdash;,”
he said, “can’t you draw up your men better than
this?” The adjutant comes, and treats the captain
to the same oath; the colonel comes and does the
same to the adjutant. Finally, when every one
was tense with expectation, the general arrived.
The soldiers off duty, anticipating something<span id="Page_173" class="pagenum">[173]</span>
extraordinary, were watching from all sorts of
hiding-places, some peering through the palings
of a fence, some mixed up with us, others even
had climbed up on to the roofs, and were peeping
from behind chimney-stacks. The general took
one look at the ranks, and then, in the presence
of the assembled troops, hurled at the colonel
exactly the same oath that the others had used,
following it up with a stream of the coarsest invective.
Our guards could scarcely contain their
delight, their glee reminded me of children when
Father Christmas appears. Afterwards they came
to us, exclaiming, “Did you hear the wigging the
colonel got? Wasn’t it fine! Isn’t the general
a splendid fellow?” Scenes like this explain why
it was so easy for the Russian soldiers to turn
upon their officers after the Revolution. They
had never been taught proper respect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TURKS AND TARTARS</div>

<p>And then there were the captured Turks with
their subject races, the Greeks and Armenians.
The more I saw of them, the more enraged I was
that the Turks were ever allowed to lord it over
nations whose shoe-laces they were not worthy
to unloose. The Greeks used to tell us how at
home they would be obliged to kow-tow and
salaam to the Turks, and with what subtle insults
these barbarians would impress on them their
inferiority. I lived for nearly two years in the
same house with the Turks, and came to know
them as is only possible in such circumstances.<span id="Page_174" class="pagenum">[174]</span>
I found them charming at first, but gradually their
character revealed itself as mean, perfidious, cruel,
stained with every vileness open to human nature.
The Greeks had abilities, range of intellect,
strength of character far beyond the reach of the
Turks. They were my best pupils, and would
compare favourably with any that I have had at
Bonn. The common Greek soldier was an ingenious
fellow, not afraid of hard work, and he
earned a fair living by his talents. The Turkish
soldier was backboneless and dull, too lazy to do
anything but beg, and he even stooped to accepting
alms from Armenians. No solution of the
Turkish problem ought to be tolerated which
leaves a single Greek under the dominion of the
Turks. The Greeks are still a race as gifted as
any on the face of the earth; given freedom, it is
impossible to foresee what they may make of
themselves, and it is a crime against humanity to
deliver them over to the repressing rule of the
Turk. There are even now newspapers which
profess to regard the Turk as a gentleman, and are
pleading that he should be spared. Unfortunately
the Turks appear to know just what note to strike
when appealing to Europe. The interview with
the Turkish Crown Prince, that has just appeared
in the papers, is a characteristic example of
Turkish “slimness.” He deplored the Armenian
massacres, had opposed them from the first,
everything was the fault of the wicked Germans,<span id="Page_175" class="pagenum">[175]</span>
and so on. And he probably looked all the while
he was saying this as if butter would not melt
in his mouth. When I read it I seemed to see
the Turks of Stretensk again, their silken accents,
their girlish shyness, their faces so lighted up
with kindness that they seemed far too good for
human nature’s daily food&mdash;and leering behind it
all unspeakable foulness and corruption. We
must harden our hearts and see to it that the
friends of the Turk are not listened to again.</p>

<p>Tartar newspapers used to circulate in the
camp, and Greeks who could read them told me
that they were all written in ironic depreciation of
the Russians and the Allies, and by subtly worded
phrases they pleaded the Turko-German cause
without seeming to do so. The Censor did not
see that a dangerous propaganda was being carried
on under his nose. There are some millions of
Mohammedan Tartars in the Russian Empire,
and there is no doubt that these newspapers
exercised a powerful influence on them. It
appears probable that, even if the Revolution
had not broken out, there would have been
grave trouble with the Mohammedans in Russian
Central Asia.</p>

<p>Then there were the Hungarians&mdash;really a
wild Asiatic race still, and scarcely tamed by
Europe. When they were at their games, no
one else cared to play, it was much better fun
watching the Hungarians. Their excitement,<span id="Page_176" class="pagenum">[176]</span>
laughter, and shouts filled the camp. At times
they quite lost control of themselves, and once,
when things were going badly with them in a
football match, they drew their knives and made
a concerted attack on the opposing centre-forward
because he was kicking too many goals. At
Christmas-time the wild, barbaric music of their
hymns was splendid to hear. Their educated
classes were always gentlemen, and, as the traditional
sympathy between Hungary and England
did not seem to have suffered by the war, intercourse
with them continued to be pleasant.
Many Hungarian officers spoke to me about their
intentions of settling down in England after the
war was over. They scarcely seemed to regard
themselves as at war with England. Caution
will be necessary in resuming relations with any
of the enemy, but it would be impolitic roughly
to brush on one side advances that may come
from Hungary. There is a good deal of the
untutored savage about the Hungarian, but he
has not the deliberate barbarity of the Hun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUSTRIANS</div>

<p>The Austrians were not particularly hostile to
England either; their venom was reserved for
Italy and Germany. They distinguished themselves
from the Germans by being able to speak
frankly about the war. They said quite openly,
we meant war and we did not intend Serbia to
escape this time. And they gave their reasons:
the last time they had mobilized against Serbia,<span id="Page_177" class="pagenum">[177]</span>
the troops had remained under arms for nearly a
year, and it had cost Austria many millions of
pounds, besides the damage done through loss of
trade. They said that could not be allowed to
happen again. Such motives are too weak to
excuse the guilt of a world-war; but I could not
but respect their honesty. They never put the
blame on to anybody else. The Austrians did
their best to educate the Germans, and to create
in them some kind of moral feeling. They used
to point out that the wrongs and cruelties committed
by the Germans in the war must inevitably
bring a bitter punishment, sooner or later. The
Germans used to stare at such ideas, mouth and
eyes wide open. They could not rise to the
conception of a moral law which you defied at
your peril. For answer they would assert, we
are so strong, no one can touch us. In one respect
the Germans showed a greater sense of self-respect
than the Austrians. You never saw a German
N.C.O. as an officer’s servant. The Austrian
N.C.O.s did not trouble about their rank, and I,
a private, had an Austrian sergeant as my servant.</p>

<p>Our amusements were the same as those of
all prisoners of war&mdash;learning languages, study in
some branch of science or art, music, and all
sorts of indoor games. We had a professional
“Kapellmeister,” one or two professional musicians,
actors, and clowns, an orchestra, and a fine
choir, so that our evening entertainments were<span id="Page_178" class="pagenum">[178]</span>
quite worth attending. Thousands of books were
in circulation. They were the one thing the
Russians did not steal from our parcels. Whatever
we wanted we could get by writing to Frau
von Hanneken, head of the German Red Cross
organization in China. The Red Cross centre
at Tientsin became much excited about the fights
for Verdun. We used to receive postcards saying
that Uncle “Nudrev” was in a bad way, his back
had been broken by a fall, and the use of his arms
and his legs was gradually failing him. Unfortunately
for the pious hopes of the Tientsin Colony,
Uncle Nudrev enjoyed a most wonderful cure.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“The man recovered of the bite,
</div><div class="indent0">The dog it was that died.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>The Red Cross stores sent by Frau von
Hanneken continued to be misused. Certain
Hungarian-Jewish medical students desired to
visit the Stretensk Yoshewara, but found it rather
expensive to keep up. So the chief Austrian
doctor, himself a Jew, used to give them Red
Cross stores to live on, in order that they might
save money for their vices. And men were dying
of tuberculosis in the barracks because they could
not get enough nourishing food. It is not my
intention to make fun of Frau von Hanneken;
she is a lady to whom I am indebted for many
services, and it is no exaggeration to say that
millions of men will remember her to their
dying day with unbounded gratitude. I am only<span id="Page_179" class="pagenum">[179]</span>
concerned with the Jews who rendered useless
so much of her good work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RANK AND FILE</div>

<p>In time the different classes shook down and
came to live together in better harmony. Quarrelling
of course was frequent. The officers were
said to have taken three thousand protocols, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>
three thousand formal notes had been sent in by
the officers, accusing their colleagues of some
breach of military discipline. The educated
soldiers and the working-men came to live apart,
and immediately began to understand one another
better. Even the thieving revealed itself only
as an expression of the good old Shavian principle:
“Thou shalt starve ere I shall starve.” I
was never tired of listening to the life-stories of
the working-man. They had nearly all travelled
outside Germany. It seems that the German
Trades’ Unions have special funds in order to
keep up hostels for their members in various
towns throughout Europe. A member of the
Union travels almost free, except for his railway
fare. The German butchers were great travellers,
and they knew all Central Europe. The stories
of their adventures seemed to come out of the
Arabian Nights. Here is one that happened to
a butcher at Brussels. He was out of a job, and
was wandering along one Sunday very disconsolate.
Two servant girls met him, and, struck
by his woeful countenance, they tried to cheer him
up. They went to the cinematograph together<span id="Page_180" class="pagenum">[180]</span>
and drank their coffee, and afterwards the girls
refused to say good-bye to him, but took him to
their home. Apparently they had been left by
some count in charge of a fine house, and here
the butcher lived for a few weeks the life of a
Belgian nobleman. He wore the silks and fine
linen of the count, smoked his cigars, drank his
rare liqueurs, perfumed himself with his exquisite
scents, and even descended into his marble bath.
Then one day the girls came to him and said he
must go, as the count was expected back. That
night he returned to his old haunts and had a
supper of pigs’ trotters swilled down with beer:
he thought it was the nicest in his life. “Isn’t it
curious,” he added, “that the nicest parts of a
pig are also the cheapest?” I ventured to disagree.
“Why,” he said, “everybody knows that
pigs’ trotters, pigs’ ears, and a pig’s snout are the
nicest parts of a pig, and they are much the
cheapest.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">GERMAN KNAVERY</div>

<p>Most interesting of all was to watch the development
of the German mind. They were no
longer exposed to the influence of the Government
newspapers, they were free to think and
speak as they had been at home. There was no
limit to their stupidity. They all believed that
America would not dare to enter the war, because
the 500,000 Germans in the States would be too
strong for them. It was surprising with what
unanimity they believed that every German in<span id="Page_181" class="pagenum">[181]</span>
America would be a traitor. When America did
enter the war, they said it was a great advantage
for Germany, because now the States would not
be able to supply Europe with any more ammunition.
And all these ideas they arrived at without
any help from their Government! Most men
would probably rather be thought a knave than a
fool, and really I think their folly alienated me
more than their knavery.</p>

<p>Their knavery was real. I long tried to
separate people from Government, and to believe
that their savagery was only something enjoined
from above. I found it quite impossible to make
any distinction between Government and people.
On our high-days and feast-days poems used to
be recited glorifying Germany’s part in the war.
The Germans are great at amateur poetry, and it
is the tradition of the Fatherland that there shall
be no festival without its poem. Our Stretensk
poems glorified more than anything else the killing
of women and children. These compositions
were greeted with loud cheers from every one
present, so we may take it that they express the
feelings of the German soldier. In one poem
Father Christmas related how he had come to
Siberia by Zeppelin, by U-boat, and by railway,
and how he had first flown over London and
killed a thousand women and children. Another
poem celebrated the bombardment of Yarmouth
in the winter of 1914-15. (It will be remembered<span id="Page_182" class="pagenum">[182]</span>
that the Germans, misled by the placing of the
buoys, did not succeed in reaching the land with
their shells at all.) The poem related how
Yarmouth was battered into ruin, and then the
last lines described how the rising wind brings
the sound of wailing. “Does that mean the
wailing of women and children? Of course it
does, and a splendid thing too.” Loud applause
from all sides welcomed this sentiment. From
that time onwards my only thought was how to
renounce my German citizenship.</p>

<p>Of course I was spied upon, nor had I any
right to complain of this. It is the custom in
every army. But from the very time I entered
the army traps were set for me in order to lure
me into some incriminating statement. Under
the mask of friendship, people were always trying
to worm themselves into my confidence in order
to find out what was in my mind. The German
takes to spying naturally; it is a trade that agrees
with his predilections. It was not always possible
for me to be wise. Once at the beginning of the
captivity, when I was suffering from high fever, I
was stung by something they said, and told the
Germans what I thought of them. I have a confused
memory of a roomful of soldiers running at
me; but I put up my fists, and they kept their
distance, the more so as the Russians at once interfered.
Later on I lived in the same room with two
Austrian doctors and a very young German medical<span id="Page_183" class="pagenum">[183]</span>
student. The Austrians and I used to have long
talks about the war, in which both sides were
perfectly frank. One day I was told that the
young German was in the habit of taking notes
of all I said, and running off with them to Remsi
Seki and Kallenbach. This noble pair of brothers
spent a great deal of time discussing what punishment
I should receive when I got back to
Germany. After I had made up my mind to have
done with the Germans, I had a splendid game
of cat and mouse with them. I was able to
sound all the depths of a Jew’s guile. Kallenbach
smothered me with protestations of friendship,
he nearly wept on my shoulder. Often he would
pretend to be a Socialist and inveigh against the
Kaiser, or, in the most plausible and convincing
tones in the world, speak of the cruelty shown to
British prisoners in Germany. Then suddenly
he would pause&mdash;his face glowing with noble
feeling, his eyes glistening with the tears ready
to fall&mdash;and wait for me to open my heart to him.
The acting was so perfect that, in spite of all I
knew about him, it seemed impossible that he
could not be genuine. He put his satellites to
try the same tricks on me. If I had agreed with
them on a single point, he would at once have
written a protocol about it, which in time would
have been added to my “dossier” at the regimental
headquarters at Cassel. I used to speak
freely, but just within the allowed limits, about<span id="Page_184" class="pagenum">[184]</span>
any matter they chose to bring up, until I could
see their eyes almost starting out of their heads
in expectation of what I was going to say next,
and then I would turn the conversation. Next
day I generally received a report of what they
had said of me behind my back, and of the rods
which their imagination had laid in pickle for me.</p>

<p>Then there came a day when the Russian and
the German doctors were exchanged, and Kallenbach
and his company went home. It was a
difficult matter for them to get their protocols
through, because the Russians would not allow
them to take a single scrap of paper with them.
Even the novels they had provided themselves
with were confiscated. There was a great scene
of preparation for departure, hair-brushes were
taken to pieces, and notes written on cigarette
paper packed in between the boards, boots and
furs were unpicked, and protocols sewn up in
them. When Kallenbach left he had smuggled
about his person reports on the behaviour of
every German in Stretensk. He thought by
being a zealous tale-bearer to curry favour with
the authorities, and to place his own loyalty
beyond a doubt. That might have helped him
under the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, but I doubt if anything
can save him if he falls into the hands of this
Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABDICATION OF CZAR</div>

<p>And then there came an interval of three or
four days without any tidings from the outside<span id="Page_185" class="pagenum">[185]</span>
world. Wild rumours were flying about, but
the wildest was surpassed when the news came
through that the Revolution had broken out and
established itself almost without bloodshed. At
Stretensk things for a moment looked serious.
The old colonel gathered his regiment together
and delivered a fiery address, calling upon the
soldiers to stand true to the Czar and country.
He was very busy in measures to counteract the
Revolution, and endeavoured to get into communication
with Irkutsk by means of telegrams in
cipher and in other ways, but the Revolutionaries
already had everything in their power and were
easily able to frustrate him. Finally, upon instructions
from Irkutsk, his second in command
deposed him and took over his responsibilities.
The colonel was a thorough rascal, deservedly
hated by all his men, and he knew it, yet he
took his life in his hands to defend his order.
Hats off to the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>! The later Governments
of Russia have not produced men capable
of fighting for them with the dignity, courage, and
devotion with which this old blackguard of a
colonel fought for the Czar.</p>

<p>The prisoners of war passed through some
anxious days. There were rumours that the
Revolution was before all things anti-German,
and that all the German prisoners were to be
killed or at least tortured. Our guards reassured
us, saying that even if ordered to shoot us they<span id="Page_186" class="pagenum">[186]</span>
would not do so. Our greatest danger came from
our own Hotspurs, who wished to make a sudden
rising and seize the camp with all the munitions it
contained. They argued that, if that were done
in every prison camp throughout Siberia, so much
damage would be inflicted that it would be impossible
for Russia to carry on the war. We
should go under, no doubt, but meanwhile we
should have done our duty to the Fatherland.
But the new commandant sent a note to the
officers, requesting them to show the same loyalty
to the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> as to the old, and to use their
influence to keep their men from regrettable
excesses. Our officers sent on a command to us
to keep quiet, and the danger passed by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KERENSKI REVOLUTION</div>

<p>In the Russian Army the Revolution at first
made slow progress. The soldiers of purely
Russian descent were puzzled and not a little
irritated by the loss of all their old landmarks.
They still clung to the idea of Czar and Church.
However, as I have already mentioned, the
Government had been in the habit of sending
their Polish soldiers to Siberia to get them out of
the way. This policy now began to bear fruit.
With almost a devilish glee the Poles set about
bringing over the Russian soldiers to the side of
the Revolution. They wasted no time on ideals
or high-falutin’ principles; they simply stated that
for every peasant the Revolution meant a big
house, a lot of land, and freedom to do what he<span id="Page_187" class="pagenum">[187]</span>
liked in the army. It was a gospel easy to understand,
and in a few days the Russians were going
about saying they would kill all the rich men and
each get a big house for himself. They refused
to stand guard round the camp against the
prisoners of war, alleging that so many prisoners
got into the town as it was, that it was no use
keeping watch over them. The last thing I heard
about the soldiers was that they were going to the
ginshops every night, and selling their boots to
buy more gin, coming home barefoot in the small
hours of the morning. The new commander went
about wringing his hands and declaring it was
as much as his life was worth to interfere. The
Poles chuckled at the turn events had taken, and
continued to pour oil on the revolutionary fire.</p>

<p>Soon after the Revolution began, I left
Stretensk to take up a position at Irkutsk as a
tutor in a Russian family. It was difficult to
leave Stretensk, although I had never been
hungrier, dirtier, in greater danger of my life, or
in worse company than I had been there. It
seemed that human nature had yielded up its last
secrets of vileness and treachery, and that no
more illusions were possible for me. I have been
asked what is the effect of such experiences upon
a man. It is difficult to give an answer that shall
not seem merely sentimental and weak. But there
are two sides to the medal. I was at Stretensk
a marked man, and those who were my friends<span id="Page_188" class="pagenum">[188]</span>
were also marked men. Their names were noted
down and reported to their regiments because
they were friends of the Englishman. They had
nothing to gain by knowing me and a great deal
to lose. And yet I had friends as good and trusty
as ever a man had, and I owe to their companionship
memories that I shall value till I die.
Human nature passed the examination, even of
Stretensk, with honours.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">PROPAGANDA</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In dealing with the Russian Revolution I shall
leave on one side those aspects that have already
been treated by other writers. Not much has
been written on Siberia yet, and what has been
given to us is mostly the product of scared
journalists, flying for their lives, and generally in
far too much of a hurry to verify their facts.</p>

<p>I shall always count myself fortunate that I
was let out of my cage in time to see the Revolution
before it had grown old. To experience
that wonderful burst of joy, which followed the
breaking of age-old chains, was the crowning event
of my life. The whole nation was feverishly happy,
and suddenly alive with hope and confidence for
the future. All the mistakes that had crippled
Russia’s conduct of the war were attributed to
the Czar’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>, and now that that had passed
away, it seemed simple to go straight ahead and
win. The soldiers for the first time in the war
were full of enthusiasm. They were well paid, the
control of their circumstances was largely in their
own hands, and, whenever anything displeased
them, they were free to complain or remove it.
There was a moral earnestness, a self-reliance,<span id="Page_190" class="pagenum">[190]</span>
and a pathetic eagerness to justify the freedom
that they had won, which all combined to give to
the Russian soldier for the time being a new
character. Inevitably, in writing of these events,
my mind goes back to those three wonderful
chapters of the “Excursion,” in which Wordsworth
describes his experiences in the early days
of the French Revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOY OF REVOLUTION</div>

<p>Just about the time of my arrival at Irkutsk
there took place the first great manifestation of
the popular will after the Revolution. It was the
demonstration in favour of the Len strikers.
About five years before, the goldminers on the
River Len had struck against their miserable rate
of pay. They had assembled and marched through
the streets, but without arms in their hands and<span id="Page_191" class="pagenum">[191]</span>
with neither the intention nor the means of doing
violence. The governor refused to listen to them
and simply ordered the soldiers to fire upon the
defenceless crowd. Two hundred were killed outright.
This needless butchery sent a thrill of
horror throughout Russia. A question was asked
about it in the Duma, but the minister responsible
merely answered with cynical insolence, “Tak
bylo tak budet” (“So it was, so it will be”). This
phrase became proverbial in Russia; it fixed irretrievably
the attitude of the Government towards
all pleas for justice and reform. The fifth anniversary
of the affair came round just after the
Revolution had established itself, and the new
Government decided to celebrate it by a great
procession in honour of the fallen. All Irkutsk
took part, including even a deputation of Chinese
coolies. It was the climax of the Revolution.
For the last time all the forces working for liberty
combined to show a united front. It is impossible
to describe the joy and eagerness of the population,
the feeling not only of freedom but also that
the old bad things were done away with for
ever. No one dreamed that within a few months
slaughters more terrible than those of the Len
were to redden the streets of Irkutsk itself. I
went to see the procession and was bitterly disappointed.
The soldiers who took part were
supposed to be celebrating a high and solemn
occasion, and yet they shuffled and slouched<span id="Page_192" class="pagenum">[192]</span>
through the streets as no good soldier does, even
when he is off duty. The heartiest enthusiasm
was shown by the Anarchists and extreme
groups, men whose wild, undisciplined faces were
livid with rage and hate, but showed no signs of
any higher emotion. With characteristic brutality
they ruthlessly shoved aside any woman or child
who got in their way or tried to join their part of
the procession. Only the small group from the
Officers’ Training Schools showed themselves
worthy of the occasion. They marched with fine
soldierly bearing and dignity, but behind their
restraint it was obvious that they felt the greatness
of the cause they were celebrating. In fact, the
procession exhibited in little all the weaknesses
of the Revolution. Despite the joy of the crowds,
it did not exalt me, it only left me profoundly
depressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUTRAGES</div>

<p>From this point onwards there came a gradual
worsening in the situation. The criminals in
Siberia were released on a promise that they
would join the army&mdash;a double folly. It not
only set them free, but it also provided them with
arms. At one time there were said to be ten
thousand criminals in and around Irkutsk. Robbery
and murder were rampant. Men were killed
in broad daylight in the open streets. Whole
families were slaughtered at once. Most of the
crimes were committed by men in soldiers’
uniforms (I cannot bring myself to call them<span id="Page_193" class="pagenum">[193]</span>
soldiers). The Anarchists joined in the merry
game by organized attacks on barracks and
Government buildings where they suspected
money was to be found. As winter came on and
the days drew in, the fun became fast and furious.
In our direction things were very lively, and we
could hear the shooting going on all night long.
We lived just on the edge of a lonely common
studded with low bushes. On the one side of us
were the barracks; on the other, about a quarter
of a mile off, the first straggling houses of the
town. The regiment supplied the thieves, who
used to lie in wait behind the bushes for any one
coming home after dark. I shall not easily forget
an evening when I took my little pupil to a cinematograph
show in the town. As it did not end
till late, I thought it would be best to take a
“droschke” home. My pupil implored me not
to; he swore we should be murdered if we did.
Finally I persuaded him it was best to ride, if
possible; but now the question was to find a
“droschke.” Not a man would come. They all
said it was as much as their lives were worth to go
near our regiment, and in the end we were forced
to walk. Not far from our house there was a
bridge over a stream, where people were murdered
every night, and where, a few days before, a
peasant woman had been killed for the sake of
her boots. As I took my pupil’s hand and we
threaded our way in the dark night between the<span id="Page_194" class="pagenum">[194]</span>
mysterious bushes, it seemed as if all the thrills in
the old nursery stories had come true. I knew
now how Jack felt in the house of the Giant, and
what it was to be hunted by the Bogey-man.
Inmates of our house drove into the town every
evening. When the firing was too intense, we
used to telephone down and warn them to stay in
the town. They always insisted on having the
carriage sent to fetch them. The coachman used
to set off, an old fowling-piece between his knees.
If it came to a scrap in the dark, he preferred
shooting with a cartridge to a bullet. They never
stopped us, but one night a wounded officer just
managed to crawl to our doorstep and lay there,
groaning in the moonlight. The sight of his
agony made me think I should always hate the
moonlight afterwards. The officer had met four
soldiers who had asked him for a light, and as he
stopped to hand them a matchbox, one of them
had drawn a revolver and had fired at him point
blank. Soldiers would lie on the ground pretending
to be wounded, and when any one came to
bend over them and help them, they would knife
their rescuer, take all his money, and make off.
No help was to be expected from passers-by.
A lady of our acquaintance was knocked down in
a crowded thoroughfare and robbed of some valuable
furs that she was wearing, but no one lifted
a finger to protect her. When she went to the
police, they looked very wise and said, “Well, if<span id="Page_195" class="pagenum">[195]</span>
you will tell us who took your furs, we will get
them back for you.”</p>

<p>Not that Kerenski’s Government did nothing.
On the contrary, they did all they could to keep
crime down; but the difficulties in their way were
enormous. The old professional police had been
disbanded after the Revolution and sent into the
army. The safety of the town was entrusted to
militia, who, whatever their zeal and bravery
may have been, were at the best only amateurs.
They could not cope with the professional
criminal. With each fresh development of crime
the militia system was extended, pickets of two
or three men, heavily armed, were stationed at
certain points all night long, and more dangerous
areas were patrolled by soldiers. Just as the
Provisional Government fell, it was elaborating
a scheme for employing some hundreds of soldiers
as extra police in the town. But nothing would
really have improved matters except sending all
the professional criminals back to prison, and
hanging all those Anarchist and Bolshevist agitators,
who were never tired of telling the soldiers
that it was right for them to take whatever they
liked, wherever they found it.</p>

<p>I need scarcely dwell on the economic difficulties
of Russia. These have been treated by
so many pens. The fall in the value of the rouble,
the closing of the frontier to the importation of
foreign manufactures, the destruction of Russian<span id="Page_196" class="pagenum">[196]</span>
factories, and the gradual disintegration of the
railway system owing to strikes fomented by the
Germans and the Bolsheviks, the consequent
scarcity in all the shops of things to buy&mdash;all this
is known. But one noticeable effect of it in
Irkutsk has not been recorded&mdash;and that is the
growth of the “yellow influence.” When I went
to Irkutsk, Chinamen were market-gardeners,
laundrymen, coolies, and small shopkeepers, and
the Japanese had a few unimportant businesses.
But with the growing anarchy of the Russian
business world, shop after shop went bankrupt,
and the place of the Russian tradesman was immediately
taken by a Chinaman or a Japanese.
When I left Irkutsk, the yellow men had the
largest shops and were doing the biggest trade.
The Russian merchant can get in no supplies
from Russia, while the Japanese are continually
renewing their stores from home. The Bolsheviks,
when they came in, did all in their power to
make it impossible for the Russian tradesman to
exist. What will happen when a stable Government
comes I do not know, but the changes here
described must have an important bearing on the
future of Siberia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLAND POPULAR</div>

<p>There was, however, another political change
still more significant. For some time after the
Revolution, England was trumps. Wherever an
Englishman went, he was treated with especial
consideration. It seemed as if people felt that<span id="Page_197" class="pagenum">[197]</span>
England guaranteed the Revolution, and that, with
England behind them, their liberties were safe.
It is difficult for people in England to realize how
important an advantage this was. The educated
Russian is drenched in German influence. He
learns German at school, and at the technical
institutes he is forced to take a course of it every
year. German universities are flooded with
Russian students. The engineering, electrical,
and chemical experts all speak German fluently
and read German technical journals. With a
knowledge of German I would undertake to sell
any goods in Russia, even if I did not know a
word of Russian. The Russians have a ridiculous
habit of attributing everything foreign that is good
to Germany. I once had the greatest difficulty
in convincing a Russian lady that “King Lear”
was not by Schiller. She thought something so
good must be German. German art, German
music, the German theatres, German scholarship
and science, German trade dominate in Russia,
and to a large extent educated Russia looks at
Europe through German spectacles. Now, all
this strongly entrenched position of inveterate
prejudice and age-old tradition seemed to have
been won by us at a blow. England was the
hero of the hour. German was banished from
schools and universities and its place taken by
English. If England had been able to make
proper use of her opportunity, she might still<span id="Page_198" class="pagenum">[198]</span>
hold in Russia the commanding position she has
held for centuries in Portugal.</p>

<p>I should like to allow myself a brief digression
on the commercial importance of Siberia. One
can only speak of it in superlatives. In the
Government of Irkutsk alone, besides the forests,
fisheries, and agricultural produce, there are
coal, iron, molybdenite, copper, lead, silver, gold,
immense beds of salt, marble, naphtha. The
Americans and Japanese know all about these
things, but very few English do. Our most
common English book of reference contains these
sentences: “In Siberia, Tomsk, Irkutsk, and Ekaterinburg
have each about 50,000 inhabitants.
Nijni-Novgorod, though small, is a station on the
trans-Siberian railway” (“Whitaker’s Almanack”).
The fact is that Tomsk, Omsk, and Irkutsk have
well over 100,000 inhabitants, Vladivostok over
90,000, Novonikolaievsk, Chita, Blagoviestchensk
well over 50,000. Nijni-Novgorod is not on the
trans-Siberian railway at all, but is the terminus
of a short branch-line. Ekaterinburg is in European
Russia. If our chief English book of
reference is so hopelessly inaccurate and inadequate,
no wonder that English merchants have
failed to realize the importance of Siberia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOLSHEVIK AGITATION</div>

<p>For a brief space, then, England held a commanding
position in the future granary, mine, and
workshop of the world. She was ousted from it
by the joint German and Bolshevik propaganda.<span id="Page_199" class="pagenum">[199]</span>
Unscrupulous propaganda is the chief and practically
the only weapon of Bolshevism, and through
it they mean to conquer the whole civilized world.
They do not rely so much on newspapers as on
rumours. These are whispered from ear to ear,
half in secret, their origin is not always apparent,
and so they gain an authority which nothing
in print could ever hope for. When Brusiloff
made his effort in 1917, the Bolsheviks spread
the report that he was a bad general, and that it
was a great strategical error to advance as he did,
he ought to have gone and retaken Warsaw.
This criticism was heard all over the town, and
when the news of his failure came through, everybody
was ready with his “I told you so.”</p>

<p>I was able to watch the propaganda in the
12th Regiment from near at hand. After the
abortive July rising in Petrograd, an emissary
came to the regiment direct from Lenin. His
antecedents were interesting. He said he had
been a schoolmaster, a prisoner of war in Germany,
and had been put to work on the land near the
Dutch border. He had escaped over to Holland
and got back to Russia just in time to take part
in the rising at Petrograd. After its failure he
was sent to Irkutsk to prepare the ground for a
similar rising. How much of his story was true
I do not know, but at any rate he came from
Germany and spoke German. He never made
any secret of the Bolshevik plans&mdash;they were to<span id="Page_200" class="pagenum">[200]</span>
bring the Government to its knees by spreading
ruin and devastation. If nothing else would do,
they would cut the railway line between Russia
and Siberia, and so starve Russia out. If one
told him tales of Russia’s miserable condition, he
used to snap his fingers for joy and say, “You
wait. It is going to be worse yet.” He used to
murmur terrible prophecies of the catastrophes to
come&mdash;every time with a Satanic glee at the
prospect he was unrolling before us. Don’t let
any of my readers imagine that this is a bygone
tale of some old unhappy far-off thing. The
Bolsheviks are at this moment applying the same
methods wherever they can get a chance to work.
The organization of disaster&mdash;that is their aim.
They want to stir up such a fury of discontent as
shall make the masses rise and sweep the capitalists
off the face of the earth. Why these fires in
London, destroying so much food? These strikes
in the great grain-ports&mdash;New York, Buenos
Ayres, Monte Video? Just as they were prepared
to starve Russia out, so also they want
to bring the whole world to its knees by
famine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOLSHEVIK METHODS</div>

<p>Our Bolshevik at Irkutsk was often in danger
of arrest, but the soldiers plainly told their officers
that they would be shot if anything happened to
the agitator. To the rank and file he preached
friendship with Germany and peace&mdash;a separate
peace, of course. He used to magnify Germany’s<span id="Page_201" class="pagenum">[201]</span>
power, and say the failures at the front arose, not
from Bolshevik cowardice, but from Germany’s
immense technical superiority. He used to
frighten them with tales of German scientists and
what they could invent. If the soldiers said a
separate peace was dangerous because of Japan,
he used to answer, “No, that didn’t matter,
Germany would not let Japan take Siberia.” In
time two parties in the regiment were clearly
marked&mdash;the real soldiers and the Bolsheviks.
The real soldiers remained very anti-German,
and were unfriendly to the prisoners of war. The
Bolsheviks, on the other hand, used to creep up
to the prisoners and say, “You are our friends,
you won’t let anything happen to us, will you?”
When the Battalions of Death were formed, they
were laughed at as fools. And when the other
soldiers were ordered to the front, they had their
explanation ready. “You are going to die,” they
said, “because Kerenski has been bought by the
English. He has received millions of pounds to
continue the war. You will shed your blood not
for Russia but to fill his pockets.” And the
soldiers used to march away, their hearts filled
with anger and disgust against England and
Kerenski. I have never seen a more miserable
sight than the Russian troops marching off to the
front in 1917. They dragged themselves along,
sullen, gloomy, almost abject in their despair,
obviously torn between craven fear of the<span id="Page_202" class="pagenum">[202]</span>
battlefield and rage at the men who were sending
them there.</p>

<p>At the same time other means were used to
bring them definitely over to the Bolsheviks.
Everything the Russian peasant held dear was
represented as in danger from Kerenski. They
were told that, once the Bolsheviks were in
power, they could take whatever they had a fancy
to. Only those who know the dense stupidity
and ignorance of the Russian peasant can imagine
how quickly this propaganda took effect. The
soldiers had no idea of the issues involved in the
war; they were fighting simply because they had
to. When the news of Korniloff’s advance on
Petrograd came, a soldier said to me, “Where is
this Petrograd that everybody is talking about?
Is it in England or in Germany?” He was from
the Manchurian frontier, and the very vastness of
his country prevented him from forming any idea
of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMERICA Y.M.C.A.</div>

<p>Propaganda was conducted among educated
people along much the same lines. Numbers of
pamphlets appeared attacking England’s colonial
policy&mdash;England in Egypt, England in Ireland,
and so on. These were invariably based on
German sources, and were no doubt paid for by
German money. The attacks on Capitalism and
Imperialism were directed against the English or
American varieties, never against the German.
The most absurd lies were spread about the price<span id="Page_203" class="pagenum">[203]</span>
America was demanding for the help she was
willing to give Russia. The Y.M.C.A. suffered
especially from these agitators. I shall never
forget hearing a Russian gentleman tell his wife
some details of the Y.M.C.A. work in Irkutsk.
“But, my dear,” said his wife, “why do you allow
them to work among the soldiers? They only
come to sell their goods.” The husband tried
to explain, but his wife would not listen. “You
are much too simple and trusting,” she insisted.
“Anybody could make a fool of you. Every
one knows that the Y.M.C.A. is a big American
firm, and that its agents are simply commercial
travellers here to push their goods.” Some
Bolshevik papers were served by German correspondents,
and articles, word for word the same,
appeared simultaneously in German and Russian
newspapers. That the Bolsheviks were in receipt
of German money they themselves never denied.
A member of the Petrograd Soviet acknowledged
it to a friend of mine. “Well, then,” said my
friend, “you are a spy.” “No,” said the Bolshevik;
“we would take money from the devil, if we could
get it.” It was especially curious to watch the attitude
of the Bolshevik press towards Henderson.
So long as he was in Russia they could not find
words bad enough for him. Only his quarrel
with Lloyd George made him a hero. Then he
became a stick to beat the English with. And
even so his appearance was against him. I showed<span id="Page_204" class="pagenum">[204]</span>
some Bolsheviks a portrait of Henderson, which
had just appeared in an English magazine. He
was smiling, dapper, and neat, and as fresh as
a rose. Everything about him was fresh, his
linen spotless, his clothes well brushed, his boots
polished to a bright shine, and he had evidently
washed and shaved that day&mdash;all things abhorred
of your Bolshevik. “Why,” they said, “he’s not
a Socialist, he’s a Bourgeois!” And in their eyes
Henderson was done for. I think if we send any
more Socialist delegates to Russia, it would be
well to let their hair and nails grow first, and also
to take their razors and soap away from them.
Then they might have some chance. When Lenin
wanted a disguise to secure him from Kerenski’s
men, he used to have a shave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST BOLSHEVIK ATTEMPT</div>

<p>All the propaganda that was going on was sure
to take effect, and in September the Bolsheviks
tried their first revolution. Their plan was simple.
The two infantry regiments which lay outside the
town were to march into the town and unite with
the regiments there in overturning the Government.
After that the rule of the Soviets was to
be proclaimed. All this could not be arranged so
secretly that the authorities should not hear of it.
The General Commanding-in-Chief came up in
his car in order personally to see the men and
hear their complaints. He was promptly arrested.
The soldiers then held a meeting to consider the
situation. I was present and recognized on the<span id="Page_205" class="pagenum">[205]</span>
platform certain officers of the regiment. It was
decided to march off into the town, and I thought
that, as a matter of course, the officers would go
with them and march at their head. But not a
bit of it.</p>

<p>The resolutions having been confirmed with
a blood-curdling yell, the officers disappeared.
Just as the soldiers were on the point of starting,
there came on the scene two hundred and
fifty Younkers (Officers’ Training Corps). They
took up a position barring the way to the town,
and proceeded to demand the release of the
general, the surrender of all arms, and that
the ringleaders should be named to them. The
left wing of the Younkers rested for a time
on our garden, and it was a pleasure to see the
smartness of their evolutions. They were real
soldiers confronting sham ones. For though this
small handful of troops had in front of them a
regiment some thousands strong, and on their right
flank another regiment, they won the day. It is
true that they had two field guns, but these could
easily have been rushed by determined soldiers.
After some hours’ parleying (extremely anxious
for us, who would have been in the thick of any
fighting) the Bolsheviks gave in entirely. As I
have said before, their officers had disappeared at
the very beginning, and most of their other ringleaders
ran away when they saw things were
getting serious. Of those who were caught, one<span id="Page_206" class="pagenum">[206]</span>
had his pockets stuffed with pornographic literature
and he was wearing women’s underclothing;
another had thousands of pounds on him, a remarkable
thing in a common soldier; while a third
was a notorious criminal who had the murder of
two whole families on his conscience. I had
always regarded as a stupid libel the favourite
Conservative assertion that the Socialist leaders
incite their followers to revolt and then keep out
of harm’s way themselves, but here was evidence
too damning. With my own eyes I saw the officers
stir the men up to revolt, I saw the officers walk
off before the trouble began, and next day, not
knowing what I had seen, these same men told
me that the whole affair had been got up by a few
misguided fanatics and cowards, and that it was
very much to be deplored.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT</span></h2>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">BEFORE THE STORM</div>

<p>Such a fiasco would have been enough to discredit
the movement in any other country. But the
Bolsheviks die hard, and they are quick to profit,
not only by other people’s mistakes, but by their
own. They saw that it was useless to attempt
anything in Irkutsk without getting the artillery
over to their side. So they set to work systematically
to detach each battery from its allegiance
to the Provisional Government. I used to hear
through the German agent how they were getting
on, how first one battery and then another succumbed,
till at last only one was left on which
the authorities could rely. In time this also was
won over. The work required patience, and it
was not until Christmas week that the Bolsheviks
were ready to turn out the Government. The
officers in the army, of course, knew what was
happening, but they were powerless. In any
case they were not trained political agitators, and
they had received no political education. They
knew little of the lives of their men, they had no
especial sympathy with their desires for more
freedom and power, and the inner meaning of
what was going on before their eyes escaped<span id="Page_208" class="pagenum">[208]</span>
them. It will probably be so in every army
infected by Bolshevik agitators. From the outset
their privileges, and the distance enjoined by their
rank, handicap the officers in dealing with these
men.</p>

<p>As usual, treachery was everywhere. Kerenski
had sent down an emissary with instructions
to watch the situation for him. The man’s name
was Strendberg, which looks German-Jewish, but
he professed to be a Finn. He spoke German
fluently; but when the Allied officers came to
Irkutsk to investigate the arming of the prisoners
of war, he denied that he knew a word of German.
After the Revolution he acknowledged that he
had played Kerenski false, and had used his
influence to pervert the army still more thoroughly.
The Bolsheviks rewarded him by making him
their Commander-in-Chief for a time. It is curious
that the German prisoners of war at Krasnoyarsk
had planned an insurrection to take place on the
very day that fighting began at Irkutsk. A War
Staff had been formed, every German officer had
his task assigned to him, and if the coup had
succeeded, it must have thrown the whole of
Siberia into confusion. A Russian officer, who
understood German, overheard the prisoners
speaking about it and reported the matter to
Irkutsk. The last act of the Provisional Government
was to take severe measures to punish the
offenders, and to make a repetition of the offence<span id="Page_209" class="pagenum">[209]</span>
impossible. If it was a coincidence, it was surely
a most remarkable one, that the Germans should
have hit upon the same date as the Bolsheviks
for their rising.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STORM BURSTS</div>

<p>Meanwhile everybody knew what was coming,
and people began to get very nervous. The most
ordinary thing was enough to start a panic. At
the sound of machine-guns practising I have seen
a crowd gather and then, taken by a sudden
impulse, run like a flock of sheep, they knew not
where. During these long months all classes of
society displayed a feverish gaiety. Never were
the streets so full, the theatres and cinematographs
so crowded, or the shops so busy.
Money seemed to have no value except to
purchase one more pleasure, before the time
when there would be no pleasures at all. I
shall not easily forget the evening when there
came a lying telegram that Venice had fallen.
The people in the streets acclaimed the news with
shouts of wild laughter, and they could not have
been merrier if their own army had taken Berlin.
It was not so much want of sympathy for Italy,
as extreme nervousness finding some excuse for
expression. The sword of Damocles hung above
our heads, and nobody knew when or upon whom
it would fall. Ordinary good-byes in those days
had something of the solemnity of an eternal farewell.
The afternoon before the fighting began, I
had been giving a lesson in the town and was<span id="Page_210" class="pagenum">[210]</span>
taking leave of the family. They asked the usual
question, “When will you come again?” A
silence fell upon us. Who knew if we should ever
meet again?</p>

<p>The storm broke at last. The Bolsheviks
occupied the chief Government institutions and
issued an ultimatum to the Younkers and Cossacks
to deliver up their arms. As this was equivalent
to saying, “Dilly, Dilly, come and be killed,” the
invitation was refused and the fighting began.
On one side were a thousand Younkers and
Cossacks armed with rifles and machine-guns; on
the other, twenty thousand Bolshevik soldiers and
Red Guards, supported by four batteries of Field
Artillery, some heavy howitzers, and a number of
siege guns. Between these unequal forces the
battle raged for ten days. The Younkers had
possession of a few brick and stone buildings
near the river Angara. The Cossacks were in
their wooden barracks, and they afterwards took
a children’s hospital commanding their position.
The Bolsheviks were everywhere else. The
Younkers showed great bravery in attack. At
the third attempt they stormed the bridge over the
Angara and blew it up, thus preventing reinforcements
from reaching the Bolsheviks by this route.
They also took the White House, the largest and
strongest building in Irkutsk. Here they captured
some of the leading members of the Soviet, whom,
however, they treated with perfect courtesy. The<span id="Page_211" class="pagenum">[211]</span>
cowardice of the Bolshevik soldiers was appalling.
At the White House some ran and hid themselves
in cellars and some in the lofts, while others
reported themselves sick. It was a building which
ten men could have held against a thousand, and
which need never have been taken at all. The
Younkers asked one lot of prisoners why they
were fighting so badly. “Well,” answered the
soldiers, “we are only fighting because we are
ordered to.” “Aren’t you Bolsheviks, then?”
“No, nothing of the sort.” “Would you fight
for the Czar?” “Yes, certainly, if we were
ordered to.” The Bolshevik theory of equality
between officers and men worked out as it always
will do under stress of actual danger. On one
occasion two scouts were wanted to carry a message
across a valley infested with Cossacks. A whole
company refused, one after the other. At last
the only two educated men in the ranks volunteered.
They had held back, not out of cowardice,
but merely because they had been doing all the
dangerous work for the company since the fighting
began. It was interesting to watch the Bolshevik
general with his men. They used to come
slouching in from patrol and the general would
try to get a report from them. He had to put
on a jovial, hail-fellow-well-met air and clap them
heartily on the back, saying, “Now, comrade,
what have you been doing with yourself?” The
comrade might, or might not, have seen something<span id="Page_212" class="pagenum">[212]</span>
of the enemy. Then the general, with extreme
politeness, as of a shopwalker conducting a lady
to the silk-counter, would suggest, “Now, comrade,
do you think you could just go and have a
look along those houses over there?” “Oh no,”
said the soldiers, “we are hungry, comrade. We
must go and have our dinner.” And the poor
general had to wait about in the cold, until he
could coax or wheedle some soldier into doing
that bit of patrol for him.</p>

<p>We were privileged to be in the thick of the
fighting. Our house was the nearest of the regimental
buildings to the Cossacks and the most
exposed to danger. On the first night a desperate
struggle took place half a mile to the north of us,
where the Cossacks tried to rush a Bolshevik
battery. In our courtyard the air was alive with
the singing of bullets, but this did not prevent us
from paying or receiving visits. And then, amid
the thunder of artillery, the rattle of machine-guns,
and all the tumult of a battle, a report was
brought to us that a mad dog in the neighbourhood
had broken loose and bitten a woman, and therefore
it was not advisable for us to venture out
of doors! This anti-climax was too much for us,
and we gave way to helpless laughter. Next
morning we were in a more serious mood. During
breakfast we noticed a Bolshevik soldier crouching
down under our window. We asked him what
he was doing. He explained that in the night<span id="Page_213" class="pagenum">[213]</span>
the Cossacks had driven them back and that our
house was now the foremost point in the Bolshevik
line. We went out to have a look, and could see
the Cossacks converging in upon us, while just
behind our garden the Bolsheviks were advancing
in open order. With all possible speed we packed
a few things together and made our way through
the Bolshevik lines to the barracks, bullets whistling
past our ears, or burying themselves with a dull
thud in the snow as we passed. At the barracks
we found the remaining officers of the regiment,
and their families, assembled. Those officers, who
did not choose to fight for the Bolsheviks, could
declare themselves neutral and were not molested.
If they asked any questions, the soldiers simply
ignored them. Some officers were really active
on the side of the Bolsheviks; but the soldiers
would not listen to their advice, with the result
that hundreds of lives were lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IRKUTSK BOMBARDED</div>

<p>In spite of the stupidity and cowardice of the
Bolsheviks, the bravery of the Younkers was of
little avail, as the numbers against them were too
overwhelming. The town was ringed in with a
girdle of fire; night and day the batteries poured
down upon it an unending rain of shell. I climbed
on the top story of the barracks in order to follow
the results of the shooting, and saw what I would
give much to forget. An especial target of the
Bolsheviks was the children’s hospital occupied
by the Cossacks. We could see the shells strike<span id="Page_214" class="pagenum">[214]</span>
it, smashing in the windows and tearing great
holes in the fabric, while, from the other end of the
building, the children were being carried away as
quickly as possible. Not all the children were
saved. Great columns of smoke and fire rose
unceasingly from all parts of the town, and it
seemed as if nothing could survive that bombardment.
After their day’s work the cannoneers, a
horrible glee shining through the grime on their
faces, used to go home snapping their fingers and
dancing with triumph, carried beyond themselves
with the lust of blood and sheer joy of destruction.
In that weird setting, the red light of burning
houses tingeing all the atmosphere, their dark,
leaping figures seemed like devils straight from
hell.</p>

<p>The Younkers were caught in a trap and their
fate appeared certain. However, the Consuls
interfered, and secured an end of fighting on
honourable terms. The Younkers were to lay
down their arms and to receive a safe-conduct to
their homes. The Bolsheviks pledged themselves
to retain only certain of their younger classes
under arms, the rest were to be demobilised, and,
like the Younkers, sent home. The fighting had
cost the lives of about two thousand men. The
numbers of the wounded will never be known,
because many of the officers and others of the
bourgeoisie, concealed their wounds out of fear
of revenge. Even schoolboys had stolen away<span id="Page_215" class="pagenum">[215]</span>
to take part in the fighting. Afterwards they
crept back to their families again, and only their
immediate friends knew anything about it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOLSHEVIK TRIUMPH</div>

<p>After so long a bombardment, I expected to
find Irkutsk laid waste. But, on the whole, surprisingly
little damage was done. Certain buildings
held by the Younkers had been battered
about, one or two schools and a printing establishment
had been burnt outright. The soldiers had
plundered and then set fire to Vtorova’s&mdash;the
Harrod’s of Irkutsk. There was also some miscellaneous
bombardment of houses in which lived
capitalists obnoxious to the Bolsheviks. This was
mean and dastardly, but fortunately the shooting
was very bad, and the houses suffered little.
Considering that the town was quite at the mercy
of a victorious and revolutionary soldateska, it
came off marvellously well. The soldiers looted
whatever houses they were quartered in, but
there was little forcible entry. One Jewish
tradesman told me how a party of soldiers broke
into his shop and demanded food. He was in
great fear of the Bolsheviks, and thought they
were going to rob him of all he possessed. But
they only took thirty pounds of sausage, and left
him without troubling about anything else. He
was amused, because the sausages happened to
be “kosher,” and contained no pork at all. I am
the more inclined to insist on the comparative
moderation of the soldiers, because the most<span id="Page_216" class="pagenum">[216]</span>
alarming reports of the Irkutsk fighting have
appeared in American and English magazines.
Here is a specimen. In an article which appeared
in <cite>Harper’s</cite> and the <cite>Fortnightly</cite> for November,
1918, an American journalist says that a Russian
gave him the following account of the fight:
“We had a nice little fuss here in January
at the time the Red Guards captured the city.
Some of the finest buildings were shelled. Three
thousand citizens lost their lives after a terrible
siege in the public museum. Several Englishmen
and Americans were killed.” Scarcely one
of these statements is true; in fact, the passage
is pure invention on the face of it. The fighting
took place, not in January, but in December.
Only two thousand fell altogether, of these few
were non-combatants, and not a single one was
American or English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNCHAINED RUSSIA</div>

<p>One non-combatant certainly was foully
murdered. This was the Socialist-Revolutionary
Patlych. He was one of the great champions of
Socialism, and he had repeatedly suffered under
the Czar for his opinions. All who knew him
respected him for the firmness with which he had
borne hardship, and for the unspoiled kindliness
of his nature. Conceiving a great horror of bloodshed,
he took no part in the fighting, but worked
for the Red Cross among the wounded. After a
time it occurred to him that he might be able to
put a stop to the slaughter by ascertaining the<span id="Page_217" class="pagenum">[217]</span>
terms on which the parties were prepared to
negotiate. Accompanied by a friend, he first
went to the Younkers, who received him politely,
and communicated to him their terms. Afterwards
he went to the Bolsheviks, who treated
him with great harshness and suspicion. At last
they took him to their leaders&mdash;three common
soldiers who refused to have anything to do with
him. He was led back through the Bolshevik
lines, and then suddenly shot from behind. His
friend managed to escape, although the Bolsheviks
did their best to kill him too, in order to get rid
of an inconvenient witness. Patlych received a
public funeral, the most imposing that I have
seen in Russia, and Russia is a land of imposing
funerals. All classes of society joined in showing
their respect to the great Socialist, and even the
Bolsheviks had the insolence to follow in the
procession. But they did nothing to punish his
murderers. I have mentioned the crime because
it is so characteristic of the Bolshevik system.
They have been extolled by certain journalists as
having discovered a new principle of universal
benevolence and the world-wide brotherhood of
the working-man. An American journalist, C. E.
Russell, has written a book, “Unchained Russia,”
in which he sweetly discourses on the loving-kindness
of the Bolsheviks. And yet we find
them murdering a fellow-socialist only because
his opinions were a shade less red than their<span id="Page_218" class="pagenum">[218]</span>
own. Their doctrine is not one of love, but of
hate, and much as they hate the capitalist, they
hate other Socialists far more. Family quarrels
are always the bitterest, and the lot of the
Socialists has been harder under the Bolsheviks
than it ever was under the Czar.</p>

<p>One final touch of horror, and I have done
with horrors. I only mention it as it is characteristic
of that Russian morbidity of temperament
which Englishmen find it so hard to understand.
After the fighting was ended, the dead bodies
were collected and stacked in various public
buildings. For days this was one of the sights
of Irkutsk, and people flocked to see it. Corpses
of men, women, and children were piled in heaps
for every one to look at. You could see fashionable
women daintily lifting their skirts and picking
their way between the dead bodies, or young girls
and boys staring with naïve curiosity at the sight.
In one building the room of the Army Paymaster
was requisitioned, and he used to sit at his desk,
faced by a wall of dead bodies, while men and
women came to receive their money. The
prisoners of war went too, and vowed that never
should a revolution cause such scenes in Germany;
they were prepared to suffer anything rather than
that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOLDIERS’ COUNCILS</div>

<p>We thus see Bolshevism sitting throned on a
pile of dead bodies. Since so many people are
still inclined to regard the movement as to some<span id="Page_219" class="pagenum">[219]</span>
extent an expression of the people’s will, it may be
interesting to state exactly how the Bolsheviks
came into power. It was only through the soldiers,
and these soldiers they won over to their side
only by the promise of peace. The elections for
the Constituent Assembly at Irkutsk just before
the second Revolution showed that the Bolsheviks
had no following except in the army. The soldiers
were bitterly hated by the people. I have seen
peasant women shake their fists in the soldiers’
faces and curse them for the disasters they had
brought on Russia. The soldiers merely laughed
and shouted, “Peace, peace.” Many of the demobilized
soldiers, when they arrived at their
homes, were shot by the peasants. Once the
Bolsheviks were in power, the soldiers insisted on
their promises being kept and on being demobilized.
They were implored to stay and fight for
the good old cause of Socialism; but they answered
roughly, “We are not Socialists. We are Bolsheviks.”
They had not the slightest notion what
the Bolsheviks were, and if you had told them they
were extreme Monarchists, it would have made
no difference, so long as they brought peace. A
list of volunteers was opened at Irkutsk, and
only fifty men enrolled themselves. The Bolsheviks
began to feel the disadvantages of the
Soldiers’ Councils they had created. The new
Government issued an order that the demobilized
soldiers were to give up their equipment and<span id="Page_220" class="pagenum">[220]</span>
rifles. The Soldiers’ Councils met and passed a
resolution that each soldier was free to take his
equipment home with him. Soldiers were willing
to sell their rifles for a song, and the bourgeois
were thus enabled to equip themselves for the
next struggle with the Bolsheviks. The most
amazing scenes took place. A friend of mine
was approached by a soldier and asked what he
would give for a machine-gun. He thought the
whole affair was a joke, and answered quite
gravely that he had got in a sufficient stock of
machine-guns for the summer, but he was rather
short of field artillery. The soldier said he would
talk to his comrades about it, and next day actually
returned with an offer to steal and sell a field-gun
at a stated price. The bargain was concluded,
and although the Bolsheviks searched
high and low for it, they never found where the
gun was hidden. Government and regimental
stores were openly plundered. The second-hand
market was full of them for weeks. Sugar to the
value of thousands of pounds was stolen from
the 12th Regiment. One night the sentry set to
guard the regimental chest disappeared, taking
with him a month’s pay for the whole regiment.
Such things as the Bolsheviks particularly wanted
to keep were removed from the different storehouses
to a common centre. On the way the
waggons openly stopped at the second-hand
market and a certain proportion of the stores<span id="Page_221" class="pagenum">[221]</span>
was sold. So badly was the Bolshevik State
organized that these thefts were never discovered
by the officials in control, the reason being that
they were mostly ignorant soldiers who could not
even count. Bolshevism, as conceived by its
leaders, may be something great and exhilarating.
But the Bolsheviks were put into power by the
soldiers, and the soldiers only wanted two things&mdash;peace
and opportunities for plunder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSPIRACIES</div>

<p>Conspiracies were constantly being formed
against them. In one of these, the town was
divided into eight districts, each under its leader.
The eight leaders knew one another, but in the
separate districts each conspirator knew only his
leader, and he did not know who else belonged
to the cause. It behoved one in those days to
guard carefully one’s tongue. I had a pupil with
whom I was on excellent terms, a business man
in the town. He showed me the damage that
the Bolsheviks had done to his house, without
expressing an opinion about it, however. He
did not know whether I might not be a Bolshevik
spy. I, on the other hand, said nothing, because
I had at last learned to hold my tongue. But
one day during the lesson there came on a great
fall of snow; I had incautiously gone out without
an overcoat, and he offered to lend me his
to go back home in. It was the only one the
Bolsheviks had left him, a musty, mouldy, old
green thing, not worth the stealing. I put it on,<span id="Page_222" class="pagenum">[222]</span>
and the effect was too much for his caution.
“Why,” he said, “you look just like a Bolshevik!”
Our laughter broke the ice, and we became fast
friends.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks had no means of satisfying
the discontent of the people. They had little
food, and did not know how to obtain more.
The peasants absolutely refused to sell to them.
The prisoners of war used to organize expeditions
to the surrounding villages to buy flour. The
peasants would at first regard them with suspicion,
and deny that they had anything to sell. The
prisoners used to protest that they were not
Bolsheviks, they were only prisoners of war&mdash;and
they got as much as they wanted. The Bolshevik
army was crumbling to pieces, and scarcely a man
was left. They managed in time to collect a few
men&mdash;ne’er-do-wells, criminals, former policemen,
and some of the unemployed&mdash;and with these
they made up a kind of army. And on one pretext
or another they disarmed the whole of the
bourgeoisie. But they had no means of resisting
any strong concerted effort to put them down.
And then some one had the brilliant idea of
organizing the prisoners of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRISONERS’ ASSOCIATIONS</div>

<p>I was able to follow this movement closely
through all its stages until I left Irkutsk. I was
at the first meeting called to discuss the question.
The hall was filled with Austro-Hungarian and
German prisoners of war, and with a miscellaneous<span id="Page_223" class="pagenum">[223]</span>
public of Red Guards, Bolsheviks, and their
sympathizers. A president, vice-presidents, and
various other officials were elected from among
the prisoners. The Germans were conspicuous
by their reserve, and held aloof. Nominally, the
meeting was under the leadership of an Austrian,
but it soon passed into the hands of a member
of the Soviet called Izaaksohn. Whenever it
appeared to be going off the rails, he brought it
back, and kept it on what was obviously a definitely
thought-out course. The feeling between the
Germans and the Austrians was very bad, and was
not improved by the taunts hurled at the former
for their cowardice in not speaking out. Finally,
a resolution was passed condemning the German
Government in round terms for its greed and
aggression, and declaring the intention of the
meeting to form an association of prisoners of war.
The misdeeds of Austria were altogether ignored
in the resolution. Prisoners’ Associations had
been formed all over Siberia. At Stretensk the
prisoners had torn the national cockade from
their caps and replaced it with the red ribbon
of the International. At Beresovka fighting had
taken place between the Germans and the
Hungarians, because the former still hung back.
At Omsk the town was in the hands of the
prisoners, who kept their officers in close confinement
and had killed some of them. They
also had the railway station in their power, and<span id="Page_224" class="pagenum">[224]</span>
would not allow any prisoners to return home.
A prisoner could either become a member of the
Omsk Red Guard or be sent back to where he
came from. The new German Association declared
that they would go home first and prepare
the ground for the Revolution, and then the
bourgeois could follow. The German Government
thought otherwise. Not a single prisoner
of war was allowed through the German lines.
I know of one sergeant who escaped and reached
the German lines in Central Russia. He was
warned to go back, but he could not believe his
ears; he thought the Germans would be certain
to welcome their own men. He insisted on
advancing, and was shot dead. Later in the
summer I was informed that the Germans were
shooting all returned prisoners who could be
proved to have had anything to do with the
Bolsheviks. The success of the Revolution in
Germany proves that some, at any rate, managed
to get through. The Austrians put their Bolsheviks
in internment camps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile strange things were happening at
Irkutsk itself. Although peace had been signed,
prisoners of war from Russia were being concentrated
at Irkutsk. Two or three hundred of them
were armed and were set to guard not only their
own encampment, but also the munition stores of
the Bolsheviks. The Russians had no faith in
their own men, and insisted on having Germans.<span id="Page_225" class="pagenum">[225]</span>
Many prisoners in the town were instructing the
Red Guards and Anarchists in the various branches
of war&mdash;artillery, cavalry, and the machine-gun.
Two or three flying machines were brought to
Irkutsk, to be flown, it was said, by German
aviators. Transports of prisoners from the east
were held up indefinitely in the town. They
came with the soldiers, subject to military discipline
as at the front. Within a day all that was changed.
Saluting ceased and discipline existed no longer.
In one case the leader of a transport was arrested
because he was paying the officers more per day
than the men. All his money, to the amount of
several thousands of pounds, was taken from him.
All the protocols that had been collected against
the prisoners were destroyed. A German sergeant
was killed in the streets of Irkutsk for refusing to
remove the badges of his rank. The Allies took
alarm at the concentration of such large armed
forces, and sent officers to investigate the movement.
They were put off with bare-faced lies.
At a time when at least ten thousand prisoners
were under arms, they were assured that only
fifteen hundred of them were so. In April there
was a great meeting of delegates from all the
associations of prisoners in Siberia. The rules of
membership were decided upon, and among them
was the following: “The members are pledged
to take up arms whenever the Central Committee
calls upon them to do so, or if there is no time to<span id="Page_226" class="pagenum">[226]</span>
appeal to the Central Committee, whenever the
Local Committee calls upon them to do <a id="Ref_226">so.”</a> In
addition to those already enrolled in the Red
Army, the Association gave the Bolsheviks an
enormous number of men pledged to support them
with arms when called upon. I say enormous
advisedly. An Austrian with whom I talked
reckoned the number at a million. This is certainly
too large, but in any case the Association
doubled, if it did not treble, the number of soldiers
at the Soviet’s disposal.</p>

<p>This propaganda soon made itself felt.
Simeonof had been able to do what he liked with
the Red Guards; they never stood up to him.
The Bolshevik Commissar for Foreign Affairs
made a despairing speech, in which he candidly
admitted that the Red Army was worthless.
The prisoners changed the aspect of affairs
altogether, and without them the Bolsheviks
would not have been able to resist either Simeonof
or the Czecho-Slovaks. By means of their propaganda
the Bolsheviks killed two birds with one
stone. They obtained help against their enemies,
they also undermined the capitalist states of
Central Europe. They were cleverer than the
Germans. Suppose that the Germans after the
Kaiser’s fall had treated our prisoners kindly, and
preached to them the doctrines of Socialism. If
it had been done in the proper way it might have
been dangerous. But then the Russian Socialist<span id="Page_227" class="pagenum">[227]</span>
leaders were true to the International, and really
desired some higher ideal than country to guide
their class. The German worker will fight to
get privileges for himself, but I never found that
he had a feeling of community with the workers
outside Germany. He preached the doctrine of
hate as cordially as his officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANARCHISTS</div>

<p>With the idea of coaxing the prisoners into
their association the Bolsheviks used to arrange
“evenings” for them. There would be speeches,
plays, some music, and, at the end of it all, dancing.
The Anarchists always attended, and were easily
the most interesting people present. Their leader
was the man I have described in a previous
chapter as having murdered two whole families.
He was thought to be insane, and there was a
horrible set stare in his eyes as if he were haunted
by the ghosts of his victims. His manners seemed
to indicate that among other laws to be abolished
were those of good society. He used to come
smoking a long thick pipe, and when he saw that
any one was at the proper distance behind him,
he used to swing round suddenly and hit the man
a smack in the face with the hot bowl. Then his
pipe used to be passed round from one to other
of the Anarchists, and, with the terrible eye of
their leader upon them, they would have to look
as if they enjoyed it. The Bolsheviks did not
quite know what to do with the Anarchists, as
none of their hirelings were anxious to pull this<span id="Page_228" class="pagenum">[228]</span>
particular chestnut out of the fire for them. They
gave a great deal of trouble. They once raided
the Police Office and destroyed all the criminal
records. On another occasion they surrounded
the market, and after having fired into the air,
stole everything they could grab in the panic that
followed. At last the Bolsheviks hit upon the
plan of sending them to fight Simeonof. They
rode through the town in fine style, their band
playing, their black flag flying, and a pleased
crowd to see them off. But when the train reached
the front scarcely an Anarchist was left. They
had nearly all sold their rifles and run away <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
route</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRO-GERMANISM</div>

<p>Meanwhile the treaty with Germany had been
signed and ratified, and German influence once
more became dominant in Russia. German officers
travelled up and down Siberia inspecting positions
for defence. Under their directions, it was said,
a great camp had been built on the River Selenga
in order to hold up any advance from the east.
At Irkutsk a building was got ready to house a
staff of eighty German officers. From time to
time prisoners of war occupied the telegraph
office, took notes of all telegrams that had been
sent, and for days together were in immediate
communication with the Fatherland. German
trade agents were busy in Irkutsk concluding
contracts on terms which the Russians protested
were very easy. Delivery of the goods was<span id="Page_229" class="pagenum">[229]</span>
promised for August, payment was to be in three
instalments, the third not to be till a year after
the close of war, and the rouble was to be taken at
par. The rich merchant class, I found, were quite
reconciled to the separate peace, since it gave them
an opportunity of trading with Germany. They
violently objected to doing business with any one
else. They understood the Germans and the
Germans understood them. It is so all over
Russia, and when the peace of the world is restored,
the Russian merchants will welcome the chance
of returning to their German friends. Nearly all
the newspapers wrote in the German interest.
An account of the attack on Zeebrugge appeared
in a Soviet newspaper under the heading, “How
they lie.” Even now German influence is still
almost as strong as ever. Within the last month
or two newspapers have been suppressed because
of their rabid Anglophobia combined with pro-Germanism.
At a certain Siberian town, when
the English Consul gave to the local papers an
account of the terms of the Armistice, they absolutely
refused to print them. They declared that
Germany would never assent to a fifth of those
terms. And finally the Bolsheviks appointed as
their Commander-in-Chief a German noble from
Riga&mdash;Baron von Taube. How came a nobleman
to be in that galley? The relations between
the Bolsheviks and the Germans were hard
to fathom. On the one hand, there was the<span id="Page_230" class="pagenum">[230]</span>
pro-German, anti-Entente propaganda of their
newspapers, and the fact that some hundreds of
German officers of high rank were in the Bolshevik
service assuming control of operations. On the
other hand, there was the Socialist, anti-monarchical
propaganda among the prisoners, which must have
been extremely distasteful to the German Government.
With characteristic perfidity the Bolsheviks
were trying to make the best of both worlds,
taking from the Capitalist Governments what they
were willing to give, and using the breathing-space
they gained in order to undermine Capitalism
everywhere. But it is still not clear how far
the German Government was ready to go, and
whether they would have allowed all the prisoners
to be armed and sent to the Japanese front. The
concentration of prisoners at Irkutsk could not
have taken place without their consent, and it
must have meant something. It seems very much
as if the recent sudden activity in the Bolshevik
armies was due to a German brain. This vigorous
and successful fighting north, east, south and
west points to a superior intellect at work somewhere.
And the Bolsheviks have shown no such
military genius in their campaigns that one might
expect it to come from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRITISH CONSUL</div>

<p>Meanwhile in this nest of German intrigue
my position became very difficult. I have not
dwelt at length upon my reasons for severing my
connection with Germany. I think they will be<span id="Page_231" class="pagenum">[231]</span>
obvious to any civilized person. In renouncing
my allegiance I left all I possessed in the hands
of the Germans, so that <a id="Ref_231">at</a> any rate I did not get
the best of the bargain. In the circumstances I
went to the English Consul, explained to him how
I stood, and that I feared that I might be made
to fight for Germany or the Bolsheviks in the
immediate future, and asked him for a paper
enabling me to get out of Russia. There followed
weary months of waiting while we telegraphed to
the Home Government. The Bolsheviks delayed
all and suppressed half of what we tried to send.
At last a wire arrived announcing that British
protection was to be accorded to me. But that
was only half the battle, the more strenuous half
was with the Soviet. They absolutely refused to
let me go. The British Consul at Irkutsk had a
great name with them; they were more afraid of
him than of all the other consuls put together.
When they heard that he was interested in a
matter, they used to give up resistance to him as
a bad job. But in my case some influence stiffened
them, and they were obstinate. Not that they
wished me ill. With that touch of topsy-turvydom,
which is never absent from Russian affairs,
they urged the Consul to let me escape. “Why
doesn’t he escape?” they said. “It is quite easy.”
And it was&mdash;for Germans. Meanwhile I was
spied on wherever I went. In the morning when
I went down to the Consul’s, a tall Austrian<span id="Page_232" class="pagenum">[232]</span>
officer used to pick me up and march behind me
with set military pace until I had “reached my
objective.” Afterwards he would follow me home
again, keeping exactly the same distance all the
while. His countenance was so lean and mournful
that I could not help christening him “Don
Quixote.” But I was sorry for the Austrians; I
thought they had more brains than to spy like
that. Then, quite unexpectedly, the Central
Soviet at Moscow telegraphed that I was to be
allowed to go. I have since found out that it
was through a lucky misunderstanding.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Anyhow
the Irkutsk people at last gave me a licence to
travel. But my troubles were not over yet. The
stations all along the line were picketed with
prisoners of war, whose business it was to see
that only the right prisoners escaped. They
cared nothing for the Soviet’s licence. At other
stations there were Red Guards whose business
it was to see that no one left Russia too rich.
Our journey was full of thrills, but fortunately
without adventure. We only just escaped, however.
We wanted to leave the train and go down
the river by boat from Stretensk; but as our
passports said nothing about this route, the local
Soviet would not allow us to go. We watched<span id="Page_233" class="pagenum">[233]</span>
the others depart with envy and regret. That
boat was held up by brigands, and the passengers
robbed of all they possessed. At other times it
is a journey I can recommend&mdash;especially in May.
Once more the hills were purple with rhododendron,
and the woods were deep with a profusion
of wild flowers, all the prettier for being unknown.
At last one evening our train ran down into
Vladivostok, and we saw again the sea, and the
<em>Suffolk</em> flying the English flag.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RELEASE</div>

<p>I have tried in these papers to avoid as much
as possible questions of principle, and without
malice or favour to relate what my experiences
were. To some I may appear like those Catholic
historians, who think that they have demolished
the Reformation when they have proved the land-hunger
of the great Protestant nobles, or like the
Protestants, who imagine that they have demonstrated
the absurdity of Catholicism when they
have made out a list of the crimes of the Borgias.
What I have said has scarcely anything to do
with first principles. The Revolution will fail, as
all Revolutions fail, in that it will be followed by
a violent reaction apparently sweeping away every
trace of its existence. The Revolution will
succeed, as all Revolutions succeed, in that it has
planted an idea in men’s minds, where it is inviolable,
and in due time it will ripen and bring
forth fruit an hundredfold. I should be sorry if
it should be thought that I have done an injustice<span id="Page_234" class="pagenum">[234]</span>
to Russia. There is no country so difficult for
an Englishman to understand. Nothing is certain
about it except its surprises. The Russians are
as muddle-headed and stupid as the Englishman
of a <cite>Daily Mail</cite> nightmare, and as quick in perception
and polished as a Frenchman, as fond of
tea and talk as an Oriental, as open-minded, acute,
and subtle as an Athenian, as lazy as a Spaniard,
as passionate as an Italian, as cold at heart and
calculating as an Irishman, honest, simple, and
kindly as the German of the good old fairy tales,
yet, in their wrath, as brutal as the Tartars from
whom they spring, and, in revenge, as cunning
and implacable as a Jew, capable in one and the
same person of superb devotion and repellent
treachery, dreamers and idealists, yet with a terrible
gift of clear vision, especially with regard to themselves,
in the highest examples of the race the
body all fire and the brain all light, the inheritors
of a language the most flexible, persuasive, and
harmonious ever moulded by the lips of man&mdash;how
could I do justice to them? There is no
need to fear for Russia. When, in the words of
Shelley’s famous chorus, the world’s great age
begins anew and the golden years return, Russia,
made alive in every part of her by the struggle
for freedom, is sure to take a giant’s share in the
building up again of our shattered universe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHAT BOLSHEVISM MEANS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We have read so much in the last day or two
about Bolshevism being established in Europe,
that it is worth while inquiring how it really works.
The accounts of it that have as yet appeared,
speak only of the murders and robberies. I wish
in this article to ignore their bloodshed and simply
to state what the Bolsheviks’ ideals are, and what
is the result when these ideals are put into practice.</p>

<p>Bolshevism is a term which may be translated
as “Maximalism.” The Bolsheviks demand the
maximum of Socialism, are the Socialists “whole
hoggers.” They start from the theory that the
middle classes are incapable of rule, and that only
two classes can govern the country&mdash;the capitalists
or the workmen. Since it has to be one of the
two, they are determined it shall be the workmen.
Their watchword is not freedom for all, but the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat, the tyranny of one
class of society above all the others.</p>

<p>Their organ of government is the Soviet.
Lenin boasts that the day of Parliaments has
passed, and that he has discovered something
better, which will take their place all over the<span id="Page_236" class="pagenum">[236]</span>
world. A Soviet is simply a Council. Its constituencies
are the various Trades Unions, who
elect members in proportion to their numbers.
The Soviet in turn appoints Commissars who
correspond to our Ministers of State. Exactly
how the Commissars are all made to go in the
same direction I do not know. Lenin spent a
good deal of time last year in writing articles to
prove that a President was as useless as a King,
and that no formal head of a Government is
necessary. From what I have heard, the absence
of a formal head only leads to a series of intrigues
between conflicting parties, which very much
hamper government while they continue, and
generally result in some dominant personality
attaining the leadership and filling up the chief
posts with creatures of his own.</p>

<p>The franchise, which is supposed to include
all those who work for their living, is a shamelessly
artificial one. To take but one instance.
In Irkutsk the Bolsheviks found themselves in
a minority in the Soviet. They thereupon declared
that the franchise must be changed, it was
too bourgeois. They succeeded in carrying
through a new principle&mdash;that the franchise
should belong to “physical labour” only. All
such occupations as demanded education were
ruled out. Some of the more enlightened Bolsheviks
tried to obtain the vote for elementary
school-teachers, but they were shouted down.<span id="Page_237" class="pagenum">[237]</span>
Similar gerrymandering has taken place in every
part of Russia. There is another peculiarity
about the Soviets. They are elected by physical
labour; but who controls them? In no case
members of the working-classes. Lenin’s principle
is that the working-man is too stupid to
know what is good for him, and he must be told
what to do. Soviet rule is a system by which a
handful of political adventurers first impose themselves
on a party and then impose this party on
the State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A TYRANNY</div>

<p>Bolshevism is a tyranny, and like all other
tyrannies has great need of secrecy. Do not let
any English readers run away with the idea that
because Lenin published the secret agreements
of Kerenski, he is therefore an enemy of secret
diplomacy himself. He concluded the treaty of
Brest-Litovsk with Germany, and the Russian
people to this day do not know all that it pledged
them to. At Irkutsk reporters had no right
to be present at the debates of the Soviet, and
such reports as did appear were officially prepared
and often issued a month late. At that
time Irkutsk was on the verge of starvation, and
it was necessary to put heart in the people with
a promise of plenty. So from time to time the
Soviet officially stated that they had reached an
agreement with China by which the frontier was
to be opened. These statements were deliberate
untruths. In a Parliament it would have been<span id="Page_238" class="pagenum">[238]</span>
possible to force a debate on this point and make
the Government explain why the frontier was
still closed and declare its policy. In view of the
fact that the Union of Democratic Control, the
<cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>, Lee Smith, and others of
that kidney have been such staunch supporters
of the Bolsheviks, it is extremely important to
realize that under Soviet rule there is no democratic
control at all, and worse secrecy than there
ever was under the Czar.</p>

<p>To turn to commerce and finance. The Bolsheviks
call themselves Communists, and aim at
the abolition of private property. Land may
neither be bought nor sold. When you die all your
property goes to the State, and while you are
alive the State may take from you what it pleases.
Nothing is yours; all is the State’s. The effete
Parliaments of the West generally estimate their
expenditure for the coming year, and plan their
taxation accordingly. Not so the Soviet. They
do indeed levy taxes, but they are always in want
of money. Their plan is simple; they go to the
nearest rich man, and “touch” him for the
amount. From one man alone at Irkutsk they
had obtained £15,000 in three months. In many
towns they had bled the rich white, and were
beginning on the middle classes. Whatever they
wanted, they took&mdash;houses, furniture, cattle,
horses, motor-cars&mdash;without any compensation.
If you were ruined, you were brutally told to go<span id="Page_239" class="pagenum">[239]</span>
and work with your hands. In one town, where
they took a house with all that was in it, the
lady had just got in a stock of underclothing for
the summer. Not conceiving what use these
things could be to the Soviet, she petitioned that
they might be handed over to her. She was told
that it was impossible, as the articles in question
had already been “nationalized.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVERYTHING NATIONALIZED</div>

<p>Everything was nationalized. It began with
the banks. You could get money to pay your
workmen with, but if you wanted it for anything
else you needed the licence of the Soviet. You
became the slave of the Soviet, and could spend
nothing except as they directed you. This power
was mercilessly used to crush opponents. All
mines and factories were nationalized and passed
completely into the control of the working-man.
They lived on the capital of the firm, gave themselves
high wages, and did no work. Most of
the undertakings had to be closed, and I did not
hear that the working-men made a success of it
in a single case. And they were far greedier
than the capitalist. One Petrograd factory was
making overshoes at a price to themselves of four
roubles a pair. They put them on the market at
forty-five roubles a pair. At the Cheremhovo coal-mines
the miners voted themselves fifty roubles a
day&mdash;whether they worked or not. As a result,
all those public services which depended on
Cheremhovo coal either showed a great deficit or<span id="Page_240" class="pagenum">[240]</span>
had to put their prices up, while private enterprises
dependent on Cheremhovo coal could not
continue. Munition factories, after peace was
signed, simply refused to be shut down. They
insisted on orders being given them to keep them
at work. Where will you find things as bad as
this in the worst days of Capitalism?</p>

<p>To come to the Land Question. The Bolshevik
formula is, “No one is to receive less than is
sufficient to support a man and his family or more
than a man and his family can cultivate.” It
puts a damper on all enterprise, sets the man of
ambition and ability on the same level with the
lazy and the stupid, and makes of the farmer a
mere grubber of the soil. The Bolsheviks boast
of having collected and distributed a large amount
of agricultural machinery. But they have “collected”
it from the rich farmers, who knew how
to use it, and distributed it among the ignorant
peasants who understand nothing about it at all.
They have driven away the intelligent and educated
men who were the backbone of Russian
agriculture and in their place have put men who
will not be able to get out of the land a quarter of
what their predecessors did. The peasants are
not grateful, but hate them intensely. The peasant
wants to own his bit of land, he wants to be free
to develop it, and he dearly loves the joy of battling
with a dealer for a good price for his crops. None
of these things are possible under the Socialists.</p>

<p><span id="Page_241" class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">EDUCATION AND LAW</div>

<p>We come to Education. Here they have persecuted
the teachers who would not acknowledge
their power, and put them on the street to starve.
In some Siberian towns they have declared that
education makes people bourgeois, and that, therefore,
all schooling must cease at the age of sixteen.
At Vladivostok they are openly inciting their
supporters to murder all students and professors.
Everybody knows that if they were returned to
power in Vladivostok not a single member of the
Oriental Institute would be left alive. At the
same time they are trying to make the stage and
the cinematograph organs of Bolshevism. No
play and no film is to be allowed that is not
Bolshevistic in tendency. It is true that at Irkutsk
they used to give “evenings” at cheap prices with
the idea of providing the people with good intellectual
fare. Mozart, Molière, and the classic
Russians used to figure on the programme. But
all they have done has been too one-sided and
special. Education demands freedom, and that
is the one thing they will not give.</p>

<p>One of the strangest Bolshevik novelties was
their reform of judicial procedure. Laws, lawyers,
and judges were abolished at one blow. You
might be prosecuted for treason. Your judges
would be chosen from the people to officiate for
this occasion only, perhaps even they would not
be able to read or write. The prosecuting counsel
would be a man of the same type. You instructed<span id="Page_242" class="pagenum">[242]</span>
whoever you liked to appear for you. The court
had to make law and find on the fact at the same
time. Having established what you had done,
they would proceed to deliberate as to whether it
came within their idea of a crime. The public
were invited to help them, and any one who chose
might speak as long as he liked. Even schoolboys
joined in. The proceedings were not so
terrible for the defendant as might appear. He
usually got a real lawyer to defend him, who could
put his case skilfully. The representative of the
Soviet was no match for him as a rule. Judges
were lenient except to other Socialists and the
Press. You were not always certain of being tried.
The Bolsheviks would arrest a group of people
on a charge of conspiracy and shoot them the
same day. The absence of laws hit the Press
very hard. All the organs obnoxious to the
Bolsheviks were suppressed one by one. It was
only too easy to convict a newspaper of sedition,
if you made up the law on the subject afresh for
each case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROCK OF DESTRUCTION</div>

<p>These are just a few aspects of Bolshevik
rule. In conclusion, I should like to give a concrete
instance of how extreme Socialism works.
A professional man at Irkutsk had by his talents
and industry attained a distinguished position.
Come the Bolsheviks, commandeer nearly all his
rooms, and threaten to turn him out on the street
and supplant him by one of their own men. When<span id="Page_243" class="pagenum">[243]</span>
he protests, they jeer and tell him he will still be
able to work with his hands. That was not the
worst. He had a wife and family, for whom he
had saved some money. If he died, the Bolsheviks
would immediately step in and take all he
possessed, including even the insurance. His wife
might get some sort of a pension; his daughters
would have to stop going to school and become
servants or waitresses; his son, perhaps, would
also have to give up his education and might
manage to get a job as a cab-driver. The Socialist
says how splendid! The children of rich and
poor on an equality at last! Yes, the lazy and
extravagant placed on exactly the same level as
the industrious and the thrifty. Whether you
spend what you earn, or whether you save it, it is
all the same for those who come after you. On
this rock the artificial restrictions of Bolshevism
are sure to split. You will never persuade a man
that the State will look after those dear to him as
well as he himself can. You cannot take from
him the right of providing with the fruits of his
labour for wife and child. He will resent, with
the deepest and bitterest anger of which he is
capable, any endeavour to rob him of these privileges,
and to make the State sole arbiter of the
destiny of his children.</p>
